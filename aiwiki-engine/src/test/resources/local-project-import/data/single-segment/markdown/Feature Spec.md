# Feature Specification: User Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

The User Authentication and Authorization feature is designed to enhance the security and access control aspects of the software system. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities within the application. By implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, we aim to safeguard sensitive data, maintain user privacy, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

## Feature Description

### 1. **User Authentication**

#### 1.1 **Objective:**
To verify the identity of users attempting to access the system and grant appropriate access permissions based on their credentials.

#### 1.2 **Key Components:**
- **Login Page:** A secure page where users can enter their credentials.
- **User Database:** A repository storing user information, including usernames and hashed passwords.

#### 1.3 **Functionality:**
- Users must provide a valid username and password to access the system.
- Passwords are securely hashed before storage in the user database.
- Account lockout mechanism after a predefined number of unsuccessful login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
- Password recovery/reset functionality for users who forget their passwords.

#### 1.4 **Security Considerations:**
- Implement strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
- Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect user credentials during transmission.

### 2. **User Authorization**

#### 2.1 **Objective:**
To control and manage user access to specific functionalities and data within the application.

#### 2.2 **Key Components:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles and assign permissions to each role.
- **Authorization Policies:** Rules governing access based on user roles and specific actions.

#### 2.3 **Functionality:**
- Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities and access needs.
- Grant and revoke permissions associated with each role.
- Enforce access control policies to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Log and monitor user activities to detect and respond to suspicious behavior.

#### 2.4 **Security Considerations:**
- Regularly review and update access control policies to align with changing organizational requirements.
- Conduct periodic access reviews to ensure that users have appropriate permissions.

### 3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

#### 3.1 **Objective:**
To add an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification.

#### 3.2 **Key Components:**
- **Authentication Factors:** Something the user knows (password), something the user has (smartphone or token), and something the user is (biometrics).

#### 3.3 **Functionality:**
- Users must provide at least two authentication factors during login.
- Implement various MFA methods, such as SMS codes, email verification, or biometric authentication.
- Allow users to configure and manage their preferred MFA methods.

#### 3.4 **Security Considerations:**
- Ensure that MFA methods are diverse and resilient against common attacks (e.g., phishing).
- Provide fallback mechanisms for users in case their primary MFA method is unavailable.

## Test Scenarios

1. **User Authentication Tests:**
   - Verify that users can successfully log in with valid credentials.
   - Test the account lockout mechanism after the maximum number of unsuccessful login attempts.
   - Validate the password recovery/reset functionality.

2. **User Authorization Tests:**
   - Test that users are assigned the correct roles upon registration.
   - Verify that permissions are granted and revoked correctly based on role assignments.
   - Test access control policies to ensure they restrict unauthorized access.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication Tests:**
   - Verify that users can successfully set up and configure MFA.
   - Test that MFA is enforced during login.
   - Validate fallback mechanisms in case of MFA method failure.

## Conclusion

The User Authentication and Authorization feature enhances the overall security posture of the application, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and interact with sensitive data and functionalities. Rigorous testing of these authentication and authorization mechanisms is crucial to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, thereby providing users with a secure and reliable software experience.
