2023-10-20 02:41:47+0200 [-] /home/andre/IdeaProjects/AI-Wiki/aiwiki-scraping-utils/test/test_markdown_writer.py:135: bs4.GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("lxml"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.
	
	The code that caused this warning is on line 135 of the file /home/andre/IdeaProjects/AI-Wiki/aiwiki-scraping-utils/test/test_markdown_writer.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="lxml"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.
