While you were here you missed an opportunity at the moment to meet with Professor Kadija Sumal , but she should be in for a meeting the following day. While there, you encountered an entity called a Judicator . These are engineered distributors of justice for the highest temples of Vasselheim . They're essentially holy hunters. In the shadow of that fear and the information that Ebenold Kai of the Grim Verity had not been at the Seminary for some time, apparently essentially abandoning his post as one of the professors, you magically persuaded the clerk of the Seminary to lead you to the house where he lives and decided to sneak in there, doing a reconnaissance mission. Upon going through there, you found that it was seemingly abandoned and slightly trapped. Then upon going into the basement, ran into two members of the Grim Verity. You followed them through a portal, met Planerider Ryn , and discovered quite a bit of information about what might be happening and what the goals are of a group called the Ruby Vanguard that is the Ruidian crew working with Ludinus Da'leth and Otohan .\n\nUpon returning to this basement, you discovered that the house was recently broken into and is being searched through by members of this vanguard. You decided to strip your clothes off and try and convince them that you were filming pornography or something. Instead, a battle ensued within this house, where you managed to defeat this troop, grabbed one and absconded with them, found a safe house and interrogated them. You reached out to Planerider Ryn, one of the members of the Grim Verity that you had recently met, who completed some of this interrogation for you. At this point, you are figuring out which direction to take, as the time of the solstice is looming and there are many paths to be chosen as you decide what your final affairs are here in Yios and what to do.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAshton responds to Imogen 's Sending and they decide they'll meet at the Aydinlan Seminary . Orym suggests Pâté could stay behind to keep an eye on the currently-docile Tuldus but they tie Tuldus up to make sure. Fresh Cut Grass reminds everyone that he's on the edge and they should all be kind to each other so that his stress doesn't increase.\n\nThey meet Ashton at the Seminary. Ashton is in the form of a young man wearing chef's whites, covered in marinara and apple pastry filling, and beat up. They drop the glamour and Imogen uses Prestidigitation to clean them up. Ashton disjointedly explains that nothing can be traced to them, but they saw Violet, a person they used to work with for Jiana Hexum , and when they talked, Ashton revealed more than they should so agreed to a quick job that included the robbing of an office, sentries, kidnapped mobsters, the Baneful Brood, artifact theft, kidnapped kenkus wrapped in expensive stolen antique rugs, fed raids, and possibly favors owed, but then realizes they had a glamor up the whole time and won't be recognized. They've also heard rumors of \"Dwendalian motherfuckers\" called the Ruby Vanguard coming through town and stirring things up.\n\n![VItro Isham - donutdraws](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/82/VItro_Isham_-_donutdraws.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230212133010)\n\nThe party decides to split up. FCG, Laudna , Fearne , and Imogen go inside and find Professor Vitro Isham , a professor of automaton studies who is most impressed with FCG. Imogen and Fearne go off to seek out Professor Kadija Sumal , who Imogen had been told had information about the Omen Archive project, while Laudna and FCG speak with Professor Isham in his office/workshop/classroom reminiscent of Imahara Joe 's shop.\n\nFCG tells Isham their full history, as far as they know it, and Isham asks and receives permission to \"poke around\" in FCG after FCG disconnects all their weapon attachments. He immediately determines FCG is a \"Harmonious Aeormaton \", designed as a diplomatic peacekeeper, possibly altered during the event known as \"The Care and Culling\" to turn on those they had been politically gifted to. His explorations go deeper than Joe's had, discovering FCG's unique and very large arcane power accumulator, which although it may be the source of their magical abilities, may also be unstable and explode if ruptured or overcharged. He warns them not to attach outside arcane terminals to it. He also encourages FCG not to be confined by his creators' expectations of him but to find their own purpose in life. He promises to send word to the Spire by Fire if he hears of any other Aeormatons like FCG. FCG has Isham install a small oven inside his chest to take advantage of the heat source there.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen and Fearne go to Kadija Sumal 's office where she nervously admits them through the multiple locks on the door only when they mention they are there about the Ruidusborn . When Imogen telepathically asks if the Judicators have come looking for her yet, Kadija recognizes her abilities. She is relieved to hear both Ebenold Kai and Roe Estani are alive and well, and confirms the nature of the Omen Archive study and that both Liliana Temult and Otohan Thull are Exaltant Ruidusborn . The Exaltant were the first to speak of the Reilora , a collection of crimson entities they met within their shared dreams of a red storm who spoke wordlessly in riddles, asking for alliance or subversion. Liliana was one of the very few who could communicate with them, but the researchers were unsure of the Reilora's motives or morality and pulled back. Kadija warns Imogen she should leave to stay safe.\n\nImogen admits she has the dreams as well and asks for any help dealing with them. After a moment, Kadija retrieves a hidden key, opens a hidden trapdoor under her desk, and pulls out a thick leather-wrapped stack of vellum pages that she removed from the Omen Archive records before they were stolen by those working on behalf of Thull and the Cerberus Assembly . She reads through for notes on what helped Liliana deal with her dreams.\n\nSuddenly, all the locks on the door unlatch and the door opens. Fearne stands in the doorway, blocking it, as it reveals there an older-looking elven man with long silver hair and blue robes. He states he's there to speak with the professor, and when Fearne asks him to wait five minutes he replies, simply, \"No.\"\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nImogen instantly recognizes Ludinus Da'leth in the doorway. Fearne successfully resists a mind control spell as Imogen telepathically warns Kadija Sumal that this person is dangerous. When Fearne requests his name, he introduces himself, but is losing patience and tells Kadija she has ignored the Cerberus Assembly 's requests too long now. The door slams and locks behind him, and he tells Kadija that necessary pieces of the Omen Archive records are missing. As she stammers, he casts a spell that drifts into her forehead, and she immediately hands over the documents, then sits quietly.\n\n![Ludinus and Imogen - nolagranola](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/c8/Ludinus_and_Imogen_-_nolagranola.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230116223412)\n\nLudinus turns to Imogen, telling her she looks just like her mother . He's heard of her skills. He studies Fearne and comments that although she's not an Exaltant , she is Ruidusborn . He asks their business there, and Imogen says she's trying to find her mother. Ludinus responds that he has worked with her personally for some time, and Imogen is welcome to ask about her. Liliana is integral to their plans, and Imogen should be proud. When Imogen asks how they could join their group, Ludinus asks if she's felt the pull northward, and Imogen realizes she has. But when Fearne continues pushing for more information, Ludinus replies that he knows they've talked to those working against his group and they're not just seeking entry. This is his life's work. If they want to help, stop resisting.\n\nLudinus dodges the question of whether he is Ruidusborn, saying he has his connections with the red moon. Imogen asks if it speaks to him directly, and he replies it has. Her mother would like to see her, as she is sad her destiny has taken her on a different path and she hopes it will not entangle Imogen in danger. Imogen tells him her mother has been pulling her towards her and she's resisted, but maybe it's time to give in. The power is pretty enticing. If they succeed, will it go away? Ludinus admits parts of it will, implying divine magic will be no more. Maybe he'll see them, to the north. As he leaves, he questions Imogen about her belief in the gods, commenting that he has seen the destruction they rained down on mortals to stunt their potential, and that The Divergence was not to protect mortals from the gods, but to protect the gods from mortals.\n\nImogen turns to the professor who is still sitting quietly, a tear rolling down her cheek. Her mind is gone. Imogen and Fearne note that Ludinus sounded like he had witnessed The Calamity , and wonder how old he is. They need to stop Ludinus, and find Imogen's mother.\n\nAt the entrance to the Aydinlan Seminary , Orym and Chetney are waiting and listening to more of Ashton 's adventures, when Orym spots Ludinus descending the stairs and exiting, joined by two figures in the familiar dark red and silver robes of the Ruby Vanguard . The party heads upstairs, worried, but are stopped by Carolle who is unimpressed by Orym's suggestions of exposing her malfeasance but is intimidated by Ashton's pulling out a marinara-covered spoon and lets them pass. Meanwhile, Professor Isham has installed Fresh Cut Grass 's oven and directs them to Kadija's office. The two groups meet and Orym hurriedly tells the others they've seen Da'leth, as they head straight to the office and reunite the party.\n\n![Ryn casting Plane Shift - Cristina Anaya](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/9c/Ryn_casting_Plane_Shift_-_Cristina_Anaya.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230130232415)\n\nImogen Sends to Planerider Ryn , telling her to come to Kadija's office. She quickly arrives and promises to get help for Kadija. Laudna checks through Pâté 's eyes and he's still watching Tuldus . They tell Ryn that Ludinus was there and recovered the Archive, which increases the urgency since the papers included the names of all known living Exaltants , the rotations of Ruidus, and its patterns during each flare. Laudna summons Pâté and Ryn promises to look after Tuldus. Excitedly, Fearne tells Ryn they're going to the Harrowcall Fens in the Feywild , as near to Grandma Morri 's house called Ligament Manor as can be managed. Ryn casts the spell and pushes the party through the portal.\n\n![Feywild Fearne - LornArt](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThey arrive, disoriented, within a lush marshland filled with large twisted trees and occasional glimpses of a pinkish-purple sky. Fearne knows where they are and guides them through the mysterious, magical forest with the apparent aid of the flowers, but they notice her appearance is ever-so-slightly different: a little sharper features, bigger eyes, longer ears, exaggerated limbs. They ask Fearne's advice on dealing with Morri and are told it's rude to refuse refreshments if offered. Fearne advises making friends with the flowers surrounding them. Laudna sings to one and it leans into her hand, but is offended when she tickles it. The other flowers lean in when she sings, but don't like being high-fived. Suddenly, they all withdraw at once and one of the trees' trunks massively lifts out of the ground and blocks their way, caging them in with its branches. Eventually, they realize that if they continue singing and playing the pan flute, the tree allows them out.\n\nFearne leads them on into the marsh and to a hidden glade among the heavy trees and branches. In its center is an enormous tree (comparable in size to the Sun Tree of Whitestone ) shrouded in dangling teal vines, with about a dozen massive branches, filled with hundreds of nests, empty wooden cages, flickering lanterns, and wreaths. This is Fearne's home , and she runs toward it. As she does, the vines separate, revealing the interior and warm firelight within. About thirty feet up, the tree splits into two trunks that spiral around each other, and each branch bears a small room connected by wooden bridges and staircases to each other and upward.\n\n![Nana Morri by seasalt fam](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nSuddenly, the voice of an elderly woman greets them from above. Fearne sprints toward it, and the party follows, finding a room decorated with skeletons in dancing poses, knitted dolls, and alien potted plants. The woman's voice greets Fearne, saying, \"Oh, Fearne, how we have missed you,\" and Fearne delightedly leaps into the long, thin arms of a wide, tall, barrel-shaped figure swathed in a blue-green robe-like dress. Emerging from a mantle around the figure's shoulders is a head on a giraffe-like neck, with long tangled white hair above a wrinkled old woman's face, nose-less nostrils, a wide smile of jagged teeth, and eyeless sockets holding a golden glow. With an eerie smile, Morri asks, \"Fearne, would your friends like a cocktail?\" A second, low-pitched and gravelly voice from the center of her torso also greets them, and Morri opens her dress to reveal two eyes and a wide mouth there that smiles at the party.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e45-ominous_lectures"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E42-The City of Flowing Light","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, Bells Hells heading southward on the continent of Marquet via the skyship that they received, bequeathed to them at the death of their dear friend Lord Ariks Eshteross , went across the Hellcatch Valley , encountered a few challenges , delved into the Gloomed Jungles of Aeshanadoor , where they encountered, after seeking them, the Gorgynei , in hopes of helping Chetney not just learn more about his journey as a blood hunter , but to possibly find a way to curb this newfound tethered murderous urge brought on by the flares of Ruidus .\n\nAfter meeting the troop, and brought to their village of Barinak , you were told the safer route for the time schedule that you're on would be to go to the temple of the savage spirit of the forest, and beseech them for guidance and perhaps a trial. There, you found this long-forgotten temple. You sat there in quiet reverie and meditation, whatever that looks like for Chetney. But while the rest of you watched, the spirit did indeed reach out to you just as the moonlight began to peek through sourcelessly. Upon narrowing its attention on what it thought you were and could become, it possessed you. While the rest of the Gorgynei watched, Chetney in his wolven form swelled to a massive size and attacked you. Unleashed, wolven Chetney, a savage beast, smelling and hungry for blood, went after each and every one of you, as you battled eventually managing to quell the beast within through a series of quick thinking, quick spells, and your friendship reaching beyond the boundaries of this fanatic nature within. And, of course, blocking the moonlight from the top of the chamber, which seemed to be the tether to this ability. His form diminished, and his brain, his mind, was recaptured.\n\nIn those moments of consideration of the trial, the Gorgynei congratulated you. The spirit seemed to leave. With this newfound experience, most of you stripped off your clothing and ran streaking into the moonlight. During which, as you were about to leave, you smelled the familiar scent of your late husband , and turned toward the statue that was in the center of this chamber. Through some strange gift of the Wildmother and her connection to his life or yours, you were given the opportunity to give your blade over to her essence, and then retrieved it, changed, improved. Holding this blade in your hand, you rushed out to join the rest of your teammates into the evening chaos.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party sleeps, waking in the Gloomed Jungles near Zha'Vrollo . Annaline explains that while Chetney isn't now a member of the Gorgynei he (and the party) are allies. The trial was more so Chetney's friends could know what they're dealing with and be cautious. Imogen casts Sending to request Captain Xandis to pick them up. While they wait, Manad brings them a breakfast rabbit, which Fresh Cut Grass learns to cook. Laudna requests its heart, which she tried to add to Pâté 's chest but it just falls out.\n\n![Fearne teaching Laudna Fireball - Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/da/Fearne_teaching_Laudna_Fireball_-_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20221219211819)\n\nOrym begins practicing the Zeph'aeratam with his newly-enhanced sword, revealing that he can shoot grasping vines up to 15 feet with his shield hand to grasp a target before slashing it with the blade from a distance. Uther urges him to name the sword. Fearne apologizes to Laudna for flipping a coin to determine to raise Orym, rather than her, and then teaches Laudna the Fireball spell, singeing Fearne in the process. Annaline spars with Ashton until the skyship arrives, then urges Chetney to rely on his friends for support. She tells him he's welcome back at any time. As the party climbs into the Silver Sun , Manad awkwardly says goodbye to Fearne and invites her back whenever she'd like.\n\nOnce aboard the ship, they head southward. FCG learns from Denalia how to cook Lord Eshteross 's cookie recipe . Orym gifts Chetney a small wooden wolf he crudely carved, and Chetney gives him a chisel that can also serve as a dagger. Orym shows him his newly-enchanted sword, which he has decided to name \" Seedling , the Wayward Pilgrim\".\n\nToward sunset of the following day, the terrain becomes hillier and they pass over the large, faintly blue-glowing Lake Koron as darkness falls. A miles-long lantern-lit bridge heads south over the lake to the city of Yios , the City of Flowing Light, built on three tiers over the blue-glowing lake and pierced by numerous canals on which boats are traveling. The Silver Sun docks at the Lakecap Skyport and Lounge and the party disembarks.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe ship is greeted by Port Captain Lyrios, to whom they pay 50 gold for a week's stay at the skyport. Xandis leads them down into the building below, the Lakecap Lounge, a combination casino and inn. Ashton buys each of the party a drink and Imogen shares her nervousness that her mother may be in the city or nearby. Laudna chooses a table well away from the others to save Imogen being near crowds. With Orym's now-incredibly high passive perception, he notices that several guards are keeping a wary eye on the crowd, and on the party, as newcomers to town. FCG wanders through the casino, picking up random thoughts from other players about a monster in the Winepebble Shores scaring fish, a viewing party for the upcoming Apogee solstice , and Stratos Throne spies caught outside Doan. Fearne chats with a half-giant guard about things a newcomer to town might want to know, including the Aydinlan Seminary.\n\n![In the casino - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f0/In_the_casino_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20221220163540)\n\nLaudna proposes to Chetney they could cheat at gambling by sending Pâté to invisibly look at other people's cards, but when Imogen telepathically warns them that Orym's noticed the guards are watching, they decide to hold off. Instead, they decide to gamble. The two available games are Griffon's Wall , a dice-based game resembling Blackjack, and Fork of the Storm, a variant of Gambit of Ord . Chetney, Fearne, and FCG play first, and the inexperienced FCG casts Divination asking the Changebringer for advice on what to do. She advises him to fold, but he calls instead, folding soon after when Fearne raises. She and Chetney repeatedly raise the stakes, and she is able to use Sleight of Hand to change her hidden first roll to an eight, but Chetney still beats her with maximum rolls on all his dice and wins 508 gold.\n\nMost of the party then play a round of Griffon's Wall, with everyone except Laudna hitting 21 and winning 12 gold each. Meanwhile, FCG unsuccessfully tries to score a complimentary room for the party with Freya , the desk clerk, even casting Fast Friends , but does succeed in renting a suite large enough for all of them for 12 gold and asking the clerk not to tell Chetney it wasn't free.\n\nUpstairs, Chetney, Laudna, Ashton, and Imogen play a last round of Fork of the Storm. This time, Imogen uses her telekinetic mage hand to nudge her dice but fails to improve her hand and the dealer ends up winning. To cheer them up, FCG tells them their room was free. Just then, one of the people who has been keeping an eye on them walks over and introduces himself: Mr. Landon Kreshawl . He has noticed they're from out-of-town, and he is a host who can guide them around town, show them the sights, and make business introductions. When he asks what they do, Laudna tells him they're a performance troupe. He offers to guide them the next day and they tell him to meet them there around breakfast time.\n\nDownstairs in their room, there are five very nice beds. They decide to order shrimp and a charcuterie board, and FCG Sends to Freya asking her to send the shrimp and pretend it's free. Imogen opens a window so she can hear the lake. Ashton tells Pâté  about seeing his birth while in Laudna's shadow realm and that they need to keep her safe. But, he says, if that's actually Delilah in there, he'll murder Pâté.\n\nChetney finds the washroom and runs a hot bath for Imogen, telling her to relax and enjoy it. When she's alone, she casts Invisibility on herself, jumps out the window, and then casts Fly . Orym notices her leave, and Imogen tells him telepathically that she'll be back. She flies out over the city, enjoying the silence within her mind, and casts Sending to her mother:\n\n“\nImogen: I'm in Yios. Are you here? I know you want to stay distant, but please... I need guidance. Please!Liliana: If you're there, then you need to stay there. Stay safe. I understand the need for answers, but it's a real dangerous journey. I've given up so much to keep you safe. At the end of it all, that's all I want. Please.Imogen: Mother, the storm is coming. If you keep running from me, I'm afraid I'm going to get swept up in it. I know I'll find you in the end.Liliana: If you keep running towards me you'll definitely end up swept up in it. Imogen. Run.\n”\n\n– \nImogen's conversation with her mother[1]\n[!h]\n\n\n\n\n![Imogen on the windowsill - Jake Wennik](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d6/Imogen_on_the_windowsill_-_Jake_Wennik.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20221219211225)\n\nImogen stays aloft for a few minutes, then returns to the windowsill and telepathically asks Orym to turn off the running bathwater before it overflows. She casts Invisibility on herself again before returning to the room.\n\nIn the morning, FCG gives them the list of possible things to pursue: Lord Preston Drodelon lives here; the Aydinlan Seminary has ancient texts they need to investigate; someone here may know more about FCG; Ebenold Kai of the Grim Verity is at the Seminary, and Orym has Roe Estani 's letter of introduction to him; Professor Kadija Sumal , who wrote the essay about Liliana Temult, is also at the Seminary. They decide to go to the Seminary first, hiring Landon to guide them there. Along the way, he tells them of the geography of the area and about some of the shops along the way.\n\nWhen they reach the Aydinlan Seminary, they hire Landon for the rest of the day and ask him to wait. As they approach the stairs leading inward, they hear a sound from above and see an avian creature coming out of the shadow, with a long hooked beak, a cloudy eye, and patches of missing feathers. As FCG franticly urges them to get inside, it swoops down.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e42-the_city_of_flowing_light"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E50-Red Moon Rising","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells , you've been traversing the length and breadth of Marquet in your skyship the Silver Sun , in transit as time clicks closer and closer to the Apogee Solstice . Upon many days of challenging encounters, terrifying weather, a few boons in your way, a quick stop at Bassuras to pick up a few magical items with some of the money that you've saved, a few connections, taking on board a terrifying fey entity that you've battled in the past as an antagonist, and then heading in a northeast direction.\n\nYou've reached out to a few allies, a possible promise of a cavalry when the time is right, and you now zero in on the final day before the solstice finds its way above the skies of Marquet.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nIn the morning, the party isn't sure exactly when the Apogee Solstice will begin, except that it will be within the next 24 hours. They realize they have no plan to deal with the destruction of the Malleus Key at the Tishtan excavation site and aren't even sure exactly where it is. Ira Wendagoth , however, knows its location and points the ship in the correct direction, saying it's about half a day away. Chetney tells him one of their plans is to use the skyship itself as a bomb, and FCG asks the Changebringer via his coin if she'd like him to sacrifice the lives of the innocents on the ship. He is horrified when the coin flip indicates \"yes\", and although Chetney urges him to embrace her message, FCG chooses to interpret it as meaning they're going to have to make some sort of sacrifice.\n\nAs they talk with Ira, Fearne pickpockets his spyglass. They discuss how to split the party so as to use the ship as a flying bomb while rescuing Planerider Ryn and Liliana Temult . They eventually decide Fearne, FCG, and Ira will stay on board while the others sneak into the Tishtan excavation site . Chetney tells Captain Xandis that they need to scuttle the Silver Sun because they are acquiring a whole new fleet of skyships and gives them the option to remain aboard during what promises to be a \"high adrenaline\" operation, or not. Xandis is skeptical and worried about their crew as well as their own safety, but allows that the ship belongs to Bells Hells and they can do with it as they want. They are very skeptical that Fearne is capable of piloting and her attempts in supervised flying barely reassure them.\n\nThe gentle dust storm closes in, reducing visibility. Ira realizes his spyglass is missing, but Fearne returns it when he needs it to see where they are. At about an hour and a half away, they land momentarily and drop off the ship's crew with supplies before continuing their journey. Imogen Sends to Keyleth letting her know their location and asking her plans, and Keyleth responds that she will look for a tree, and Imogen should let her know when they \"need the cavalry\". Of the ground party, Orym , Imogen, and Laudna wear the captured Ruby Vanguard robes while Ashton wears the yellow cape of Paragon's Call .\n\n![Fearne and Ashton's goodbye - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1d/Fearne_and_Ashton%27s_goodbye_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20230307122819)\n\nWhen they reach about a mile away, flying low, they land the ship in the dust storm and the landing party bids farewell to Fearne, FCG, Ira, and Xandis. Ashton gives Fearne a farewell hug, reaching into her pocket as he does so. She catches him and gives him a kiss on his head as a goodbye.\n\nThe ground party sets their crawler on the valley floor and crowds into it, taking off toward the excavation site. When they're close, they hide it behind a stone and proceed on foot. Eventually they pass a haggardoe tree large enough for Keyleth to use Transport Via Plants and Orym carves the Ashari symbol into it. To one side, he notices a shadowy shape that as Chetney cautiously explores, he realizes is a fairly recently crashed skyship bearing religious markings. Although now scavenged, it was once heavily fortified and armed, and appears to have been shot down with harpoons and taken in a resulting battle on the deck.\n\nAs they continue forward within view of the edge of the excavation pit, Laudna sees a bright point of light appear in the tracking sphere attuned to Otohan Thull . From this point, they can see moving patrolling figures, hulking automatons , and an occasional crawler through the swirling dust. One of the crawlers passes nearby and looks at them suspiciously, but moves on.\n\nThe party continues forward, trying to blend in with the other guards and workers. As they approach an encampment, they are noticed by three humanoids in the uniform of the Ruby Vanguard , who halt them and ask who they're with. Imogen responds, \"Miss Temult\" and tells him more information is above his pay grade. Her deception is successful although the guards scrutinize the party very carefully as they move to the edge of the pit and begin climbing up its lip. Suddenly, the guard halts them again and tells Imogen that another guard has recognized Orym and Laudna from the battle in Ebenold Kai 's house in Yios . Although Imogen tries to reassure him, he isn't buying it and orders Laudna and Orym into custody, calling over an automaton as well as two other guards.\n\nImogen telepathically tells Laudna and Orym to run but the guard casts a spell, causing Ashton to freeze in place. Chetney runs toward the guard, assuming his werewolf form as he goes.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Warder 2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b8/Warder_2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230303213046)\n\nRoll initiative!\n\nLaudna casts Bane on two of the three guards and the towering Warder automaton . The mage guard attacks in turn, hitting Chetney with a Fire Bolt , but Chetney 's immediate counterattack damages the mage enough to break his concentration on the Hold Person on Ashton . Orym seriously wounds the mage further, and Imogen finishes him off with a Shock Flare , along with another of the guards that Ashton had already significantly damaged.\n\nThat leaves the Warder and one remaining guard to deal with. Most of the party focuses on the Warder, with Laudna throwing Pâté \"like a rubber chicken\", casting Shocking Grasp through him, and Chetney leaping onto his back and clinging there searching for an \"off\" switch. The guard attacks and wounds Imogen , but Ashton immediately retaliates and kills him. However, the Warder sprays hideously damaging fire at both Ashton and Orym. Imogen commands it to \"Grovel\", and it obeys. The entire party attacks the now-prone Warder, each hitting and damaging but not destroying it. Finally, Laudna finishes it off by casting another Shocking Grasp through Pâté. Amazingly, none of the other patrolling guards or Warders are close enough to have been alerted to the battle.\n\nSuddenly, Imogen feels a hand around her throat pull her backward into the tent. A whispered voice in her ear demands to know why they are fighting the Ruby Vanguard . Chetney and Ashton see her move into the tent and come toward it to investigate, joined by Orym, but the unseen figure continues to pull her backward and down out of sight. Imogen telepathically asks if the person is fighting the Vanguard as well, but there is no response, and she is pulled out the back of the tent. Angrily, she demands that they at least speak face-to-face, and is turned to face her captor: a hooded female with dark brown skin, wearing blue sleeveless robes and carrying a staff on her back. Imogen tells her they're Bells Hells, and they're trying to prevent the release of whatever's up there. The woman says she's on a similar path, and asks her to call over the others.\n\n![Caleb and Beau - @zhellers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/16/Caleb_and_Beau_-_%40zhellers.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230305151417)\n\nImogen is still being held like a shield, but the woman suggests they speak somewhere more private and pushes her toward the tent. Imogen first telekinetically moves a fallen tent to cover the fallen Warder. They all move inside the standing tent, where Chetney (still in werewolf form) dresses in the fallen guard's clothing. The woman tells Imogen she's been pursuing this path for about a decade now. Her goal is to destroy the Malleus Key , and, if possible, beat up Ludinus Da'leth and escort him to prison. Perhaps they can help each other out. Addressing the air, she calls, \"You got my back?\" and a figure in a long high-collared coat and purple scarf, flames flickering around his hands, appears at the front of the tent. In a Zemnian accent, he tells them to stay seated so they can have a conversation.\n\nOrym asks if they are part of Grim Verity , and the Zemnian tells them they're friends to the Verity. They arrived here with Planerider Ryn , who was doing reconnaissance when a glyph ward went off. There have been many terrible things happening around the world in connection with the Solstice including ritual sacrifices, summonings, and those with magical ability and dubious morals trying to seize this opportunity. Some have been real, and some, distractions for the Ruby Vanguard. He and Beauregard , the woman, have been following Ludinus for many years and Ludinus knows they're coming. Imogen shares Bells Hells' connection with Otohan Thull , a name the Zemnian is familiar with, and that Imogen's mother is working with Ludinus. The Zemnian responds that there are two generals working under Ludinus: Exaltant, considered a serious threat, and Thull. When Imogen reveals her hair, both he and Beauregard realize they may be fighting her mother. Beau asks if it's okay if they kill her mother, and Imogen responds she'd rather she help them, instead. But she doesn't know if that's a possibility.\n\nBells Hells share they have reinforcements waiting to be called in, with a skyship bomb. The two newcomers saw the crashed skyship fall, and believe it came from Vasselheim , finally alert to the danger posed by the Ruby Vanguard. They have not seen Ludinus at the site for several days, and entering it has become more difficult since the recent installation of the periodic anti-magic pulse. Imogen admits they might have caused that since they destroyed the Fey Realm key, which impresses Beau since she and the Zemnian just returned from the Shadowfell , where they damaged but could not destroy the key there.\n\n![Caleb and Beau - Giulia Valentini (kurocyou)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe Zemnian gives their names: Caleb Widogast and Beauregard Lionett . They are here alone, although they had companions from Grim Verity in the Shadowfell, who didn't make it out. Caleb shares what he knows about the construction and its wards: the regular magic-dispelling pulse, a mage hunter golem guarding it, its use of distilled dunamis and a decentralized mesh of power devices put in place here after the assaults on the keys in the Fey Realm and Shadowfell. Caleb and Beau noted that Ludinus' actions had been much more obvious than normal, almost as if he counted on opposition. He seemed to be operating outside the Assembly on this, because Caleb has \"someone on the inside\" who has been unaware of his activities, while the other members fear him too much to speak up.\n\nThe party shares that Keyleth has also promised aid. Beau thinks that the anti-magic pulses are coming from a pattern of mirror-like devices on the sides of the pit, but they are uncertain if the pulses come from the mirrors, or the mirrors are simply reacting to them. The party also reveals they're working with Ira Wendagoth , and Beau knows of him and is wary of his potential motives. The two groups decide to approach from opposite sides and try to meet in the middle. Caleb gives them a sending stone to use to contact him if needed.\n\nWhen a crawler approaches, both Caleb and Beau melt away. The guards accost the party about the fallen Warder but believe Imogen when she tells them it's malfunctioned, and move on. Beau reappears and wishes them luck, telling them to let her and Caleb know if anything happens. She disappears toward the pit as the party tries to figure out their next steps.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e50-red_moon_rising"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E47-The Fey Key","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nAs the time before the Apogee solstice grows ever closer, in fact, just about thirteen or so days away, you went to the City of Flowing Light, Yios , to seek information about the Grim Verity and some of the missing pages of the history of Ruidus and the study that was surrounding it, the Omen Archive . Upon looking up this, you learned some things about yourselves, some things about FCG , some things about your mother through some visions and an encounter with some of the Ruby Vanguard , a faction that is working underneath or with certain elements of the Cerberus Assembly and Ludinus Da'leth , who surprised you while you were talking to one of the professors at the Seminary .\n\nAfter that brief encounter and returning back to your recently acquired ally, Planerider Ryn , you decided to head to one of the three locations of these Malleus Keys that are all seemingly aligned in some way to trigger at some point during this apogee solstice. You decided to head towards the Fey Realm , where Fearne is from, and where the first of these keys was seemingly constructed a number of years back. With Planerider Ryn's help, you were transported to the Fey Realm, deep into the Harrowcall Fens . You traveled a short distance, to the interior of Fearne's abode under Morrigan , the Fatestitcher, within her home known as the Ligament Manor , a beautiful, mostly shrouded treehouse where you stayed the night, learned a bit about her history, the source of her jovial personality, and acquired a bit of information heading towards where this key may be.\n\nYou began to hike towards the Sablecast Grounds where a location known as the Shiver Keep exists, and there, floating somewhat ethereal in the sky above it, is the out of place image of Ruidus . You pushed through these swamps, you briefly-- not really had a conversation with, but quickly destroyed and set aside a group of centaurs that were plotting upon finding you to bring you back to the Unseelie Court , and continued your journey towards this ominous keep.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party stands at the edge of the Sablecast Grounds looking out into its dark expanse with the faint light of the artificial Ruidus hanging above it, remembering that the portal back to their own plane is located due west of it. Fearne guides them stealthily into the valley, dotted with occasional needle-like 60-foot tall towers. Laudna summons Pâté and has him transform into a bird to scout the tower. When he is 200 feet away, he begins sparkling with the purple light of a Faerie Fire . Through his eyes, Laudna can see the forest grows ever thicker.\n\nSuddenly, they hear the loud cry of a creature. To determine if the creature is a danger, FCG flips his Changebringer coin and announces they're safe. He has decided that the Changebringer gave him the coin and he should allow it to guide him; it is a thing that makes choices and that's exactly what he is. Faith means trusting the goddess. The others try to convince him to trust his own judgment as well, but he seems unconvinced.\n\n![The Nightmare - @cpprcoyote](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/34/The_Nightmare_-_%40cpprcoyote.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230206133156)\n\nThe light around Pâté fades in about ten minutes. He can see that the towers form a rough ring around the Shiver Keep , with the ghostly image of Ruidus held aloft roughly a mile above with a single thread-like red beam holding it \"like a still balloon in the sky\". A large shadowy flying entity is circling around the keep. Suddenly, the connection breaks as Pâté is presumably taken out. The party carefully sneaks between the towers, and Orym sees lights approaching. Ashton casts Pass Without Trace on the party and they hide as a gateway magically opens in a wall of brambles and a masked war band of 15 emerges, whose red-skinned leader rides a Nightmare . They search for the party but do not spot them and move on. The group tries to sneak through the bramble gap but Ashton steps into quicksand-like mud and is trapped. They yelp, drawing the attention of the patrol, and as Imogen runs past she casts Invisibility on Ashton. As the patrol searches, Ashton's leg takes damage but they remain hidden, and Chetney throws some ball bearings that distract the searchers. Fearne remembers Morri telling her that \"if the ground grows wanting, be sure to pay it the iron tithe.\" Ashton throws their bag of jacks [1] into the muck and it releases them.\n\nThey carefully move on through the bramble forest and reach the Shiver Keep, which FCG attributes to the new-found power of his goddess, the Changebringer . The Keep is well-guarded and defended. They notice two dog-like creatures called eremads being led on chains on the parapet above, with voids where their faces should be, and Laudna recalls an old saying that \"You can't hide from the eremad.\"\n\n![Eremad - KageSatsuki](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/c0/Eremad_-_KageSatsuki.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230204010030)\n\nThey discuss possibilities to enter the keep. Chetney casts Invisibility on himself and scouts the closed, locked, and guarded gates. He cries, \"Hey, over here!\" and takes off running. One of the guards chases the voice as Chetney transforms into a werewolf. Imogen casts Invisibility on Laudna, and with Orym clinging to her back Laudna Spider Climbs up the wall. Evading the eremads, they reach the parapet at the top, looking down into a courtyard filled with trees of all kinds. Within it is a large device, the Malleus Key , surrounded by six armored figures and two more eremads.\n\nMeanwhile, the guard chasing wolf-Chetney decides he's not worth his time and breaks off. FCG casts Banish on the guard still at the gate. Ashton pulls out the portable hole and lays it under the door, allowing the party to climb in and emerge on the other side, but they are spotted by the returning guard. Chetney grabs him before he can raise the alarm and Fearne casts Hold Person on him, and they join the others in the hole. FCG drops Banish on the first guard, and he returns where he was, dropping into the hole as well. The party jumps out and Ashton folds the hole, trapping both guards inside it.\n\nThe party is now inside the outer wall of the keep, hiding in the shrubs. The doors to the fortress itself open, and two figures emerge and walk to the Key. One is tall and clearly of higher station to the ordinary guards, the other is a female figure they recognize as Otohan Thull . Laudna confirms with her tracking orb that Otohan still carries the ring. Orym reads their lips as they speak, learning from the tall figure that Sammanar is at the end of their patience. He wants Otohan to remind Ludinus Da'leth of their arrangement and that he can be removed, and is scathing of her perceived lack of respect for him. Otohan tells him that when the Moonweaver is gone, he will be more forgiving, and uses a magical scroll to transport herself away. The remaining figure calls to \" Gloamglut \" to come to him. Above them, a massive winged serpent-like creature crawls over the wall and the figure mounts it and flies off.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Battlemap, the Malleus Key](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/c8/Battlemap%2C_the_Malleus_Key.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230204025814)\n\nInside the courtyard, the party considers their options, both to sabotage the Malleus Key and to escape afterwards. Laudna and Orym each have about 40 minutes of Invisibility remaining, and the guards in the portable hole have suffocated, so Ashton and Chetney put on their armor, and Ashton leaves his glass hammer in the hole in exchange for the guard's battleaxe.\n\nFCG establishes Sympathetic Binding with Orym, Laudna, and Ashton. Fearne wildshapes into a tiny slow loris , and she runs over to the key while the invisible Laudna and Orym Spider Climb there. Laudna slides into a gap at the top by the telescope arm extending outward but reaches a point where she can't see what's ahead. Fearne also climbs up the machine, but accidentally dislodges a tool on the way, drawing the attention of the patrolling eremad , but she's able to hide from it. Laudna meanwhile investigates the arcane nature of the Key and determines she can either try to find something critical on the inside and remove it, or overcharge the power cores on its exterior. As she pushes further in, her hand gets caught in the gears and she takes crushing damage before pulling free.\n\nOrym joins Laudna inside and she Prestidigitates a light, losing her invisibility, but Orym can't tell what any of the arcane machinery does. They decide to use dynamite, coordinating with arcane blasts from those still outside. Laudna messages Imogen their plans and they agree the explosion will be their cue. Imogen messages Ashton and Chetney their plans and they agree to try to get the exit gate cleared and unlocked for the group's escape. They're able to remove the crossbrace barricading it and unlock it, but when Ashton tries to gum the lock with pasta dough, a guard with an eremad notices them.\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna (now visible) Spider Climbs out and down the wall, but Fearne stays to make sure Orym gets out all right. A guard spots Laudna and shouts at her, and Orym takes that as the signal for him to light the fuse and climb out, joined by Fearne clutching his leg. One of the guards takes a shot at Laudna, who blocks with Shield , and Orym leaps off the tower onto a guard, pushing him toward the device. Imogen takes that as her cue to cast a spell, and twins Witch Bolt at the device, hitting two arcane cores but not severely enough to destroy them.\n\nAs combat initiates, the guards are fairly easy to hit and not doing much damage. Laudna Eldritch Blasts two more arcane cores, damaging but not destroying them, and Imogen's next magical attacks make two of the cores unstable. Fearne then casts Wall of Fire in a circle surrounding the Key, and they hear a crack like breaking glass followed by the hum of the machine fading. Suddenly, the Malleus Key explodes as all of the cores explode in a chain reaction, vaporizing the nearby guards, causing massive damage to Laudna and Fearne, and slightly less to Orym, who evades some of it. The Malleus Key itself is totally destroyed. The tether leading to the Ruidus image in the sky disappears and the moon blinks out. They hear the cry of the dragon-like creature in the sky.\n\n![Orym during the battle - Cha Cha Rae](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen is attacked by one of the eremads , suffering damage when her arm is pulled into the void of its face. Orym uses Bait and Switch with Imogen, and Chetney is able to finish off the creature with Shatter . However, the party is now taking damage, with Laudna barely alive. They begin making for the exit as quickly as possible. Ashton fairly easily kills another of the enemy before using his Wormhole Shift to reach one more and intimidate him into running away. The dragon-creature Gloamglut lands on top of the keep, shrieking, as the party all dash toward the gate. Imogen casts Invisibility on herself and FCG. They hear a voice crying, \"Gloamglut! Show them why no one crosses Sorrowlord Zathuda .\" The creature flies towards them and releases a swirl of dark energy, its Dark Fire Gaze catching Orym, Fearne, and Chetney, doing serious damage to all and leaving Fearne barely conscious. The guards also attack with crossbows as the party dashes toward the gate, using every trick they can think of to move faster and pull the slower ones along with them. Finally they have all reached the gate, Fearne and Laudna the last there. Orym uses his Grasping Vine to pull Laudna through. Gloamglut lands within the courtyard and can just reach Fearne, clawing at her and knocking her unconscious just outside the gate.\n\nGloamglut cannot squeeze through the gate to pursue, and the party pull the unconscious Fearne with them as they run the last ten feet into the cover of the bramble forest. They pull the Harrowcall Veils over themselves as the creature takes to the air to search for them.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e47-the_fey_key"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E49-The Aurora Grows","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells had barely escaped the Fey Realm after leaving a twisted mass of arcana and metal behind that was once considered a Malleus Key , seemingly beyond reconstruction in the time window before the solstice is to arrive. You were chased into the woods as you reached for the Exandrian gate out of the Realm, by the flying fey dragon and its rider above, the Sorrowlord himself. You managed to dodge murder, have a bout of rhyming interactions with the keeper of the Exandrian gate , and then eject yourself through back to your home realm, which you found to be beyond the threshold of Aeshanadoor and actually within the old home turf of Imogen .\n\nUpon deciding, with the solstice being within a short period of time, your best journey towards it would be to recall your airship as your port buddy was seemingly discovered, Planerider Ryn vanishing from communications while on site . You walked over towards Gelvaan , where you are from, interacted with your father to ask some questions, gauge the tension of that relationship, and through some conversation, managed to acquire a keepsake, a relic of your mother 's. The airship arrived, spooked the bumpkins, as Captain Xandis called them, and you climbed atop the Silver Sun heading in a northeastern direction back toward the Hellcatch Valley , eleven days until the Solstice begins.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nOn the deck of the Silver Sun , Orym watches the faint colored energy drifting in the sky. He draws it to the attention of the others, but none of them (including Captain Xandis ) know what it is. Chetney vaguely remembers something like it happening several hundred years ago.\n\nThe party brainstorms potential allies including Lord Eshteross (dead), Planerider Ryn (frozen), Keyleth (busy), the Grim Verity (some on other Planes of Existence ), Jiana Hexum , the Nobodies , Ira Wendagoth , Percival and Vex'ahlia de Rolo , Orlana Sheshadri , Dorian , Nana Morri , Imahara Joe , and Imogen 's mother Liliana Temult . Fresh Cut Grass reminds them that he is similar to the automatons at the Tishtan excavation site and suggests he might be able to infiltrate the location and act as a suicide bomber. There is some discussion of using the dusttra of the valley in the attack. When checking to see if she can tell if the party is being surreptitiously observed psychically, Imogen for the first time notices a faint static background buzz when she opens her mind.  \nThey decide to start contacting people. Imogen Sends to Ira, and he is enthusiastic about destroying the Malleus Key . He is at the Calloway Hideaway just east of Bassuras , which they should reach in six to seven days. FCG then contacts Imahara Joe, requesting a bomb and a single-rider vehicle, which the Calloways will pick up. FCG also Sends to Milo Krook asking him to reassemble the Nobodies and get them to Bassuras in six days, but Milo has no way to get there. Imogen then contacts Ebenold Kai but he is still on the Elemental Plane of Fire with no way to return.\n\nChetney suggests mounting a bomb on the ship itself that could be crashed into the Malleus Key as a fail-safe, last-ditch effort, and to that end, Fearne and Ashton volunteer to learn to sail the ship. As the day draws to a close, Orym contacts Dorian via the sending stone , warning him bad things are coming, but Dorian's in Tal'Dorei with the rest of the Crown Keepers and Opal is getting \"a little dark.\"\n\n![Liliana Temult - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5e/Liliana_Temult_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20230218133820)\n\nAs evening approaches, FCG casts Shared Dream on Imogen, Orym, and Fearne, and all four go to sleep so Imogen can seek out her mother . She finds herself in the familiar dream landscape, and almost immediately finds Liliana. Imogen tells her she needs her help, but as her mother's image becomes more material, she warns Imogen she shouldn't be there. When Imogen tells Liliana she's going to help destroy the world, Liliana responds that Imogen misunderstands what's happening; the world will be saved, not destroyed, and they'll be free. She sends a vision to Imogen of a massive glowing lattice in the sky pulling apart as thousands of voices join in freedom, without guidance or fate... and Imogen without her psychic powers. \" He \" is doing this for everyone, but Liliana is doing it for herself and Imogen. With that, she sends the Bells Hells group out of the dream.\n\nImogen is confused. What if destroying the gods isn't a bad thing? But Orym responds that his family died for her brighter tomorrow. Imogen is still shaken. Although FCG's faith in flipping his Changebringer coin is shaken when it seems to indicate the goddess is evil, it does indicate she wants them to succeed. Ashton points out that if the project's goal was indeed good, they'd be telling people about it, not killing people.\n\n![Ashton and Laudna - Suraelis](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/fc/Ashton_and_Laudna_-_Suraelis.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230220215056)\n\nThe group separates. Chetney realizes the auroras in the sky are the Exandrian ley lines beginning to glow and shift as the apogee solstice approaches. Laudna joins a heavily-drinking Ashton with a bottle and asks directly who they are and where they come from, but Ashton answers there isn't much to know. Ashton is a blank slate with no past and is jealous of the others because Ashton knows loneliness they don't. Laudna points out she spent 30 years alone in a forest. She knows loneliness. The willingness of the others to die to try to bring her back a second time from death still haunts her. Ashton asks her what it was like to have them still there when she came back from death, because when Ashton died their friends left, but Laudna responds that it was great because it wasn't like that for her the first time she died, either. She asks him directly about the Hishari helmet from the Twilight Mirror Museum , but Ashton repeats that they have almost no childhood memories, just that there was an accident and their family was torn to pieces. Ashton joined Bells Hells because Orym mentioned the word \" Ashari \", which was similar to the one word Ashton remembered from childhood, \" Hishari \". The increasingly drunken Ashton admits they were trying to put the others in their debt enough that they would help Ashton down the line. Ashton remains reluctant to open up fully to the others.\n\nMeanwhile, Fearne pulls Orym aside. She asks what they should do if Imogen decides \"to go to the other side of things.\" Orym shares her concern. If it comes to that, Fearne will be with him. They just need to watch her, and if the worst happens, Orym will try to distract Imogen while Fearne does \"the thing.\" Fearne is doubtful, but agrees.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Xandis and the auroras - PryingBlackbird](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/34/Xandis_and_the_auroras_-_PryingBlackbird.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20230221164314)\n\nThe skyship journey continues northeastward toward the Hellcatch Valley . Fresh Cut Grass Sends to Pike Trickfoot asking for her help, and she hesitantly says she'll see what she can find. Imogen sends to Jiana Hexum asking for contacts in Bassuras and she advises them to visit Yunis . Fearne and Ashton learn to fly the skyship, while Imogen checks in with Nana Morri , learning she is injured and feels strongest at home, but will be watching and do what she can. FCG warns Dancer to get somewhere safe for the solstice . Imogen suggests FCG try to contact \" D \", the mysterious merchant who sold the aeormaton to Dancer, and FCG hesitantly does so, asking where they were found and if there are more like them. An answer comes: \"A wonderful surprise. That is my gift to you: a return to your own path. I pulled you from the wreckage, and your future is yours to make. And there are more of you, and more to come.\" [1]\n\nSeveral days into the voyage, they hit a massive dust storm that delays them a day. Ashton apologizes to Laudna , claiming not to remember what he said while drunk, but she calls his bluff. Orym contacts Dorian again asking if he can also see the now-visible ley lines from Tal'Dorei , and he can. They also message the Calloways that they're coming and to go pick up the items Imahara Joe is working on for them, and message Ira with their expected arrival time.\n\nFinally, they arrive at Bassuras around midday, but sail past to the Calloways' hideout. Birdie Calloway greets them and welcomes them in. Ira Wendagoth and Ollie are working on the Veilscatter Scope , but Hondir also greets them and shows them the bomb Imahara Joe prepared for them. Ira is pleased they've arrived, and explains he was the creator of the Malleus Key in the Fey Realm , but was fired by Ludinus Da'leth after its completion and now wants revenge. He is happy it's been destroyed and lets them look through the Scope at the Tishtan excavation site where Paragon's Call and the Ruby Vanguard are both present and construction is proceeding on the Key there. Suddenly, the vision fades, and Ira explains that approximately once a minute the site sends out a burst of anti-magic.\n\nIra is unsure of the exact purpose of the Key, although it definitely has to do with Ruidus . He believes if the Moontide Crown were to suddenly surge in the device it would be destroyed, although recently the power sources on the device have been hidden. Ira has also prepared a second bomb, in addition to the one from Joe. Imogen tells Hondir that Planerider Ryn has been turned to stone, saddening him. Fearne passes on to Ira Nana Morri 's greeting, and he responds immediately and with maximum creepiness to tell her \"Hi\" as well.\n\nAt this point, they are six days from the Solstice and still four to five days of travel distant from the Malleus Key site. Orym, Ashton, and Imogen head into Bassuras and the general supply shop of Yunis which Jiana Hexum had recommended. Yunis doesn't acknowledge the name until the door is safely closed and locked. They are able to purchase two greater healing potions , and several magic items at the cost of all their gold and gems. They safely return to the hideaway.\n\nHondir asks about the other members of the Grim Verity and opts to remain behind. He discourages them from sharing their information with the temples of Vasselheim , since Ludinus Da'leth has been careful to hide his tracks until very recently and they would not be believed. The party decides to head out immediately with Ira on their skyship, further northwest toward the Tishtan excavation site. While they travel, Laudna paints large symbols of the Cerberus Assembly at several places on their ship. Orym contacts Dorian and warns him to get the group underground and stay there. Dorian responds it's \"a little hairy\" there, too, but he'll do his best.\n\n![The Silver Sun and the Ley Lines - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe next day, they lose another day of travel to an arcane wind, triggered by the shifting of the ley lines, bringing fierce lightning. The nights are growing brighter with the aurora light produced by the shifting ley lines, as the face of magic across Exandria changes. With four days till the solstice, they encounter yet another dust storm, and Orym notices a shadow in the storm and hears the sound of wings as a massive black and purple fiery bird begins pursuing them. They dive the ship and Imogen Commands the creature to \"Leave!\" but when it wears off, it circles back. They throw a couple of spells at it that hit but don't faze it, but then Fearne successfully Polymorphs it into a goldfish and it blows away.\n\nAt three days till the solstice with two more days of travel, Orym feels a pulse in his side pouch and discovers it is coming from the seed given to him by Thrascuur [2] back in Niirdal-Poc . FCG Identifies it as a Message Bloom seed, so the party plants and waters it, and it blooms to deliver a message from Keyleth . The leader of the sect she was helping to fight against in Terrah escaped shouting about the Ruby Vanguard , and she needs to know where the Vanguard is so the Ashari can help the party's stand against them. Imogen immediately Sends to Keyleth telling her they should arrive in two more days and that their destination is the point where the ley lines are converging northeast of Bassuras.\n\nThe next day, the ley lines are continuing to grow in strength. The static in Imogen's mind when she opens to it is also louder. While Orym is meditating on deck, Imogen approaches and asks if his tattoo of the moons ever feels tainted by events. Orym replies that it doesn't; the tattoo represents him and Will , and it only makes it seem as if he was meant to be there. Imogen replies that she's grateful they were brought together, and Orym tells her he's not worried about her.\n\n![Imogen and Laudna's conversation - cvleart](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen then goes to talk to Laudna. She admits that this is scary as hell, and she feels like they haven't talked since Laudna came back. But she is uncertain as to whether this is the right thing to do. Laudna tells her they always have the ability to make choices, even with the gods, and that whatever Imogen decides, Laudna will be there to support her. They hug each other, telling each other they love each other, and Imogen pulls out the locket. It reads, \"The better halves make a better whole,\" and Imogen has decided that means you have to love it all, including their powers. They go to sleep sharing the bed.\n\nThe glowing ley lines fill the night, on the night before the apogee solstice begins. In the morning, the Silver Sun begins its final day of travel.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e49-the_aurora_grows"}

Upon searching them out, you also discovered that there are elements of the Vasselheim temples that have sent sentries and judicators across the city searching for, you presume, those who stole the secrets that the Grim Verity currently hold.\n\nYou also were assailed by a terrifying necromantic bird that seemed to be the long legendary Shithead that in the past had harried and chased this poor automaton . After killing it and watching it climb itself back up and then flying off into the distance, you began to seek out where Ebenold Kai may have been, being told that he had nor attended his classes and had abandoned his post as a professor for a number of months. You managed to ascertain the information by literally magically charming one of the figures who works at the Seminary . They guided you to where he supposedly lives, but the house seemed to be closed up and upon inspecting it, found that some elements of it were trapped and set up in a defensive way.\n\nSome of you masqueraded as gardeners out front while the others stealthed their way in before letting you in. Upon searching the household, there were signs of life but no individual to be found until you discovered a hidden passageway behind the kitchen wall that led to a basement in which the figures within managed to escape, created an arcane circle and bamfed away. You gave chase and found yourselves within the fire elemental plane , specifically within the home laboratory of Planerider Ryn , who you met, along with Ebenold Kai and pretty much the current remaining members of the Grim Verity within the city that you know of, Dr. Baryn Vestisho as well. Here, you discovered some unique tidbits of hidden lore surrounding Ruidus, surrounding its creation, and surrounding the gods that no longer exist: the two that vanished [ Vordo and Ethedok ] in the long-sealed tomes of Vasselheim, and the entity responsible for devouring them, Predathos , the entity that supposedly was sealed away when the moon was created as its prison and sent beyond the boundaries of Exandria where it has slowly floated through the sky till this day. You also know that these strange machines, the one that you knew was being built within the Feywild long ago by a union between the Cerberus Assembly , Otohan Thull , and Ira Wendagoth , the Nightmare King. Apparently it is but one of three: one that exists in the Shadowfell , and one that exists here in Exandria within an excavation site that the Seminary was currently overlooking before it was forced to cede control to the Assembly in recent months.\n\nNow, after discussing some possibilities on how to tackle any of these challenges with just a little over a week left before the solstice itself occurs, you were sent back into the basement of Ebenold Kai, and before you could exit out to see your next wave of fortunes, you heard a heavy impact from the inside of the house above, some footfalls, and some words. It seems the house is being stalked by individuals who are seeking others.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nHearing the voices and heavy footsteps from above, Laudna attempts to block the door with the immovable rod but since the door opens the wrong direction, it won't hold long. Chetney proposes they could all pretend they had been attacked, or they could all start fucking, like it was some crazy orgy. The party chooses the second option. They overhear conversation from above, indicating that some entity that is controlled by one of the voices saw them enter the premises. Chetney strips. Using Detect Thoughts , Imogen senses four presences above, one of which is moving extremely rapidly. Laudna has Pâté Shapechange into a spider and scout into the kitchen, where he finds a half-elf wielding a blade and an air elemental which almost immediately sucks Pâté in. Fearne strips.\n\n![Naked Fearne - Kayla](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f4/Naked_Fearne_-_Kayla.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230109212944)\n\nThe air elemental infiltrates under the basement door and Laudna rips off her blouse as Fresh Cut Grass shines spotlights on the party. Chetney runs up the stairs and transforms into werewolf form, as Orym (acting as a doorman) bars the elemental's way, saying, \"Invite only.\" Imogen begins unbuttoning her vest as the rest of the party continues to try to convince the elemental it's interrupted either an orgy or the filming of a porno film. Eventually the half-elf enters as well, demanding to know what's going on. When he refuses to be put off, Orym uses his Grasping Vines to pull him down the stairs and stab him. A female wielding two blades also vaults down the stairs, hitting both Chetney and Orym, followed by a third heavy crossbow bearer who hits Chetney again. Imogen tries and fails to convince the attackers that this is a porno film set, but the half-elf notices the lightning marks on her arms and orders the others to \"Take them! Now!\" Imogen immediately Misty Steps to the top of the stairs and into the kitchen, followed by Laudna Spider Climbing .\n\nChetney, in wolf-form, runs up the stairs and throws the enemy at the top of the stairs down them, moving into the kitchen, but the air elemental darts up after them. The robed elementalist climbs to his feet and casts a Cone of Cold , hitting FCG and Fearne for full damage and Orym for half. Fearne transforms into a massive Clydesdale horse and clambers up the stairs but gets stuck at the doorway into the kitchen. FCG casts Command on all three enemies (to \"Command\") but it affects only the elementalist. Orym is able to use Bait and Switch to move FCG up onto the stairs while facing off against the rogue and the elementalist still at the bottom, but the rogue flips over them and runs out into the kitchen, attacking Chetney and hitting for sneak attack damage, mitigated by Laudna's Silvery Barbs forcing a reroll on the initial natural 20 attack roll. The third assailant pulls out his longsword and attacks Orym, then successfully reaches the top of the stairs.\n\nImogen Twin Spells Psychic Lance , incapacitating the rogue and severely injuring her. Chetney then attacks her with Turmoil in scythe form, bringing her to death's door. Fearne (still a horse) is finally able to get into the kitchen and kicks the crossbow-wielder back down the stairs as she goes, and he takes FCG down with him. As Fearne charges into the kitchen, Laudna goes prone to get out of her way but Chetney slams into the horse and halts her progress. Back at the bottom of the basement stairs, FCG sees the foe lying prone next to them and casts Banishment to send him to a demiplane and out of the battle. FCG hops to the top of the stairway and gives their new trusted companion, Laudna, a bonded blessing. However, they're starting to \"get the jitters\" - on their mood board they're crossing into the red.\n\n![Escaping the cellar - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b8/Escaping_the_cellar_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20230111173901)\n\nOrym knows the gods are watching, since they've survived this long, and uses a Grasping Vine to Spiderman himself into the kitchen and attack the rogue, getting the How do you want to do this? Seeing this, the heavily wounded elementalist uses his orb to shoot a Lightning Bolt that heavily wounds Laudna, FCG, Chetney, and Fearne, knocking Fearne out of horse form. He then leaps out the window into the alleyway, lying dazed. Meanwhile, Imogen casts Inflict Wounds on the elemental, and Laudna sends spider-Pàté back into it, casting Shocking Grasp through the familiar. Though seriously damaged, the elemental is still up. Chetney leaps out into the alley and attacks the prone mage, knocking him out and throwing him back into the kitchen. The freed elemental flees after its attack on Imogen is negated by Laudna's Silvery Barbs .\n\nTheir enemies all unconscious, banished, or fled, Fresh Cut Grass casts Spare the Dying on the mage as they all take stock of the noise the battle has created in the residential neighborhood.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party decides to take the mage with them and get out before the third assailant returns from Banishment . Fearne changes back into a horse; they throw the unconscious mage over her back, covered in curtains, and cautiously move out into the street and into the nearest alley. They successfully stealth to the mercantile Endeavor Ring. When the mage begins stirring, Chetney knocks him out and FCG casts Spare the Dying again. Imogen gets directions to the Eastward Docks, and when the mage stirs again, telepathically tells him to stop moving if he knows what's good for him. Eventually they find a small storage space with two young orcs loading a cart pulled by a panther-like jungle cat. When they leave, Chetney picks the lock and the party goes inside. As they pull the cover off the mage, he casts Misty Step into the street and starts running, but Imogen casts Misty Step as well and Commands him to stop. Back in the warehouse, Orym ties his hands together.\n\nThe mage is defiant and angry, but reveals that they'd been watching Ebenold Kai 's house for some time. He assumes, since he found them there, that they are allies of the Grim Verity , and he won't answer their questions. Orym takes his components, Laudna Banes him, and FCG casts Fast Friends on him. Under its influence, he reveals he is a member of the Ruby Vanguard , a group whose goals are diametrically opposed to those of the Grim Verity . The party guesses the group is trying to release Predathos from its prison within Ruidus .\n\nThe mage explains that since the beginning of mortals' existence on Exandria , they have been under the control of the deities . The Ruby Vanguard dreams of a future where mortals can be free of this control, by restoring the natural balance and unleashing the natural predator of those beings who call themselves gods. Their leader developed these beliefs and has been instrumental in creating the plans that will come to fruition at the apogee solstice , but the mage is reluctant to reveal his name. Imogen asks if they're working with Otohan Thull , and he will say only she's been \"rather instrumental\" to their organization.\n\nWhen Orym mentions Ira Wendagoth , Imogen telepathically detects the mage's distrust of Ira and that their leader may still be in the area. She sees flashes of an older, handsome, stoic elvish man with long silver hair . Imogen asks the mage where this leader is, and is told he's probably handling \" the keys \". She sees mental flashes of three large machines similar to the Veilscatter Scope : in the Feywild , the Shadowfell , and under construction in a sandy hollow amongst ruins. Chetney searches him again and finds he is wearing glyph-inscribed bracers that FCG Identifies as Bracers of Defense .\n\nThe mage reveals his compatriot Genomia had been watching the house, as they'd been searching for Ebenold Kai for some time. Imogen asks how they know that once Predathos devours the gods it will be satiated, and is told it only feeds on divinity. Their leader knows this, because he speaks with it, and \"When the shark finishes eating the fish, it doesn't go after the plankton.\" Imogen is worried about what would happen to the souls of the dead, if the gods weren't around. Orym asks what all of this has to do with Zephrah and gets a whisper on his insight check.\n\nThe party briefly talks about what information they still need and what they should do next. They ask again where his leader is, and suggest the reason he doesn't know is that he's just not that important in the organization. Nettled and furious, the mage reveals his own name, Tuldus , and eventually reveals the leader's name is Da'leth , but Imogen telepathically confirms he really doesn't know his current location. FCG suggests he feels this way because of trauma in his past, and Imogen reads his emotional wounds from being punished for lack of piety and lack of religious focus, and forced to pray for hours. She begins to sympathize, and to rethink their plan to kill him after the questioning, but they can't figure out an alternative. Eventually, Imogen suggests Sending to Planerider Ryn to see if she'd take him, and all agree that's a good idea.\n\n![Planerider Ryn - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/37/Planerider_Ryn_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/230?cb=20230109203401)\n\nRyn is indeed interested and immediately appears when they describe the warehouse. She casts a spell on Tuldus that convinces him to hand over his bracers, and advises the party to keep a low profile since one of their attackers is still free and alive. She also identifies the mysterious machines being built as the \" Malleus Keys \". [1] When she asks Tuldus which machine is the most vulnerable, he suggests there is growing tension between the Cerberus Assembly and the Unseelie Court . He knows nothing about the one in the Shadowfell .\n\nThe party asks Ryn to transport them to the Feywild and she agrees, but they're still missing Ashton . Ryn goes off for cheesesteaks, and the party takes an hour's short rest to recover health and spell slots. FCG reminds them he's feeling jittery today and maybe they should go to the Feywild without him. He'd like to talk to the people in town who can tell him more about his identity. But they have to find Ashton first. Once recovered, Imogen casts Sending to Ashton telling them \"shit is going down,\" and they need to meet up and leave town, stat.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e44-bawdy_basement_belligerence"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E43-Axiom Shaken","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells , after finishing their excursion to meet up with the Gorgynei to aid Chetney in dealing with this strange new tethered Ruidus -odd lycanthrope incursion, took on elements of the bestial spirit that existed within the temple , went through the trial, and in doing so, walked away with a little bit of inspiration to move forward with this curse that he bears. All of you then absconded back to the skyship that awaited you, and headed off to the City of Flowing Light, Yios itself. Upon arrival in the evening there in the skyport , lounge, and casino, you played some games of chance . You made some coin; you lost some coin. You gathered a little bit of information about the surroundings, and essentially prepared yourselves for the following day. You booked a room for the night and met an individual named Landon , who was eager to show you around the city for a bit, for a little bit of coin.\n\nHe met you first thing in the morning, as you made your way to the bottom part of the tower and then began your first day out amongst the city here in the middle of the lake . Wandering around, you had some tidbits of a history lesson on the town. You managed to eyeball a few interesting locations as you headed toward the northern ward of the city, the ring that contained your destination for the morning: the Aydinlan Seminary . While you walked through the wide, well-groomed streets, you eventually found among the statues of various historical figures who founded and maintained the city of Yios since its first construction, to the grounds of the seminary itself, the high walls and gardened elements, the free-standing archways, and the visage of the massive buildings that form the actual seminary halls. Upon approaching the tall climbing stairs and leaving your companion Landon behind to possibly go about his business and maybe come back around if you need more help wandering through the city, you began to ascend the stairs before FCG heard a familiar sound, and saw a familiar sight.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Fearne sheltering FCG - Cae chromaheart Farrington](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3e/Fearne_sheltering_FCG_-_Cae_chromaheart_Farrington.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20221227194353)\n\nThe bird-like entity dives at Fresh Cut Grass , defecating on their head although they escape being poisoned. Fearne hides FCG under her dress while Orym uses Bait and Switch to stand in front of them, Imogen hits with Inflict Wounds , and when Fearne hits with Ice Knife the creature tumbles to the ground, unconscious. Chetney grapples it and FCG casts Spare the Dying , but the creature then seems to be slowly healing itself, and Chetney senses it has an undead signature. When FCG casts Speak with Animals and demands what it wants with him, Shithead responds that there's just something about him he has to ruin. He just doesn't like the way he looks. With that, the bird breaks free and flies off, pursued fruitlessly by Pâté de Rolo .\n\nThe party then notices Ashton is missing, and when Imogen Sends to them, they reply that they're \"following a thing\". Laudna confirms she hasn't heard Delilah Briarwood in her head since she was raised from the dead .\n\nThey decide to go forward with exploring the Aydinlan Seminary , entering and asking Carolle the receptionist for Ebenold Kai , but are told he cancelled his classes a few months ago and hasn't been there since. He lives in the Vigil Quarter of the Dominion Ring. Kadija Sumal still works at the Seminary, although they're not scheduled to be present until tomorrow at noon. Suddenly, the busy hall grows silent with polite apprehension as a hulking figure enters wearing a bronze mask bearing fine script and symbols but without eyeholes or features. It had arrived in town with a representative from Vasselheim , and Fearne recognizes it as a Judicator , a guardian of one of the High Temples of that city. It silently scans the room and exits, to the relief of the students and faculty present. Carolle says there are at least two currently present in the city, and the Seminary staff has been instructed to leave them alone, as they don't want to get involved in any \"messy theological business\".\n\nCarolle is reluctant to share Ebenold's home address and is beginning to grow suspicious of their questions. FCG casts Fast Friends on her and she shares the name of the head of automaton studies and directs them there. She also volunteers to escort them to Ebenold's home, and along the way they try to befriend her so she'll still like them when the spell wears off. She admits she has a thriving side business in selling the various knick-knacks she finds, including a \"really nice\" bronze statue with emerald eyes that had been being used as a paperweight in the Seminary by a Professor Dinon. When they reach the home, Orym gives her 5 platinum as they part.\n\n![Chetney in the chimney - thespiceyhoney](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/15/Chetney_in_the_chimney_-_thespiceyhoney.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20221227195150)\n\nThe house has a fence in front, and the gate is padlocked. Chetney goes invisible, is boosted by Ferne over the fence and unlocks the gate. He notices the front door is trapped and there is no answer to his knock, so Imogen makes Orym invisible as well and both he and Chetney climb up onto the house while the others act like gardeners. The windows are Alarmed , so they move onto the roof, and Orym warns the rest of the party about approaching sentries. Chetney shimmies down the chimney into the main bedroom, which has an Alarm thread all around it. He steps over it and out while Orym stays on the roof. Chetney catches a faint smell of nervous sweat, but sees nothing. He cautiously explores, then calls out with no response, so he tries to disarm the trap on the front door but sets it off. A black substance spreads out in front of the door, so he opens a window and the rest of the party climb in.\n\nOrym investigates the front room but finds nothing, while Imogen reaches out telepathically and senses two minds beneath them. Chetney lockpicks a rolltop desk, setting off its trap and taking acid damage but finding nothing inside. Meanwhile, FCG moves to the kitchen, taking some baking supplies, and Laudna notices some oddness in the stones of the kitchen wall. Working together, she and FCG pull up the wall into the ceiling, revealing a rough staircase descending into darkness.\n\nOrym and Chetney stealth down, still invisible, and the scent of sweat grows stronger. They hear a voice and see a skull gently tossed to roll in front of them. Its eyes flash searingly white, blinding and frightening Orym. Two figures in the back of the room overturn a table and shelter behind its barricade. Chetney calls for the others, and Orym fearfully asks that the figures not kill them if one of them is Ebenold Kai - they were sent by Roe Estani . As the rest of the party enters, the female half-elven woman with Ebenold finishes reading a scroll, and their corner alights with a large circle of glyphs and symbols on the floor. Ebenold and the woman run into the circle and vanish, followed by Laudna, Imogen, and the rest of the party.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party find themselves in a hot, dim cavern lit by indirect firelight and a channel of slowly flowing lava. [1] Bookshelves and other furniture are scattered about. The two fleeing figures are across the chamber, but Ebenold stops the woman from firing her crossbow at Orym 's shout that they have a letter from Roe Estani , which he hands over. Orym tells them they're seeking aid from the Grim Verity as Ebenold reads the letter. He tells her to put down the bow and introduces himself.\n\n![Planerider Ryn by Clara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/da/Planerider_Ryn_by_Clara.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20221225113808)\n\nWhen Imogen suggests the judicators are in Yios looking for them, Ebenold agrees. While he did not steal the ancient texts referring to the two forgotten gods from Vasselheim , [2] his companion Dr. Baryn Vestisho was one of the three who did, and she believes the judicators are pursuing her. Right now, they are all in the Elemental Plane of Fire in Planerider Ryn 's home. She has been quietly standing in one corner. Ryn is wary at first, summoning a guardian fire elemental , but the party explains they are also researching Ruidus and following the trail of the Lumas twins .\n\nImogen shares that she and her mother are both Ruidusborn , and that her powers and the dreams have been increasing, causing Ebenold to wonder if she is an \"Exaltant\", a Ruidusborn who exhibits particularly strong connections. The lightning marks on her arms are very like some of the others. When Imogen mentions Liliana , her mother, Ebenold knew her.\n\nEbenold explains there are many members of Grim Verity across Exandria, but he and his compatriots in Yios have been helming the development of the Omen Archive . Meanwhile, Baryn and her group had located some \"inconsistencies\" in the historical records and had dedicated themselves to finding ancient texts dealing with forgotten gods. One of her compatriots was taken during their recovery of the texts, but she and the other, Janina , escaped to Yios. Janina is now investigating the potential nexus site in the Hellcatch Valley of the coming apogee solstice . Recently, judicators have appeared in Ank'Harel and then Bassuras , where Hondir 's home was destroyed. The rest of Grim Verity is scattered and in hiding.\n\nRyn joined the group through her research into the link between the movement of the ley lines throughout Exandria, producing bursts of energy that coincided with Ruidus 's flares. In researching this, she discovered the Omen Archive project and became friends with members of the Grim Verity . She also discovered abnormalities in the two planes closest to the Prime Material : the Feywild and the Shadowfell , where mechanisms with an unknown purpose were being built. The party tells her about the city on Ruidus and the magical woven divine latticework surrounding the moon.\n\nBaryn tells them the contents of the ancient texts: Ruidus was created by the gods during The Founding , when an entity they feared arrived from beyond the stars, called Predathos , which destroyed the deities known as Ethedok , the Endless Shadow, and Vordo , the Fateshaper. The other gods imprisoned Predathos within the moon where it remains, forgotten. However, the recent increase in flare activity, along with the coming apogee solstice, has led Grim Verity to fear that something is about to happen. Their concerns were ignored by the temples of Vasselheim, and they are now being hunted.\n\nThe party asks about Otohan Thull . Grim Verity believes that Thull is assembling an army of Ruidusborn in the Hellcatch Valley of Marquet, but they do not know for what purpose. They theorize Predathos is creating anchors to Exandria through the Ruidusborn, and that their powers come from that entity. Liliana was the first and strongest of the Exaltant, but Otohan and the Cerberus Assembly found her and her need for answers overrode her judgment. Ryn's current goal is to stop Otohan from accomplishing what Ryn believes is Thull's goal: to release Predathos.\n\nFearne tells them that Imogen has advanced abilities, and that she once blew out a city block, and Ryn agrees to try to teach her some control over her power. Ryn also explains that the Cerberus Assembly and Otohan have been building matching devices in the Shadowfell and Fey Realm where the planes overlap to the nexus on Exandria. The Exandrian site is at the excavation of an ancient Tishtan ruin in the Hellcatch Valley commandeered by the Assembly from the Aydinlan Seminary three months earlier. It was the focus site for an apogee solstice many centuries before, leading Ryn to believe the ley lines shift in a recurring pattern.\n\nEbenold and Ryn both counsel against trying a full-out assault on Otohan's group, as they are seriously outnumbered, but suggest infiltration and stealth. Chetney suggests they have someone on the inside they can take advantage of: Imogen's mother. Laudna suggests Imogen herself could be a double agent, but FCG is convinced it's too potentially dangerous for Imogen's emotional health. Chetney points out they don't even know what the machines do that Otohan and the Assembly are building. Ryn knows only that they have a planar projector or tether aspect, and suggests that the machine in the Shadowfell is the most ramshackle of the three. However, they have a strong potential ally in the Feywild in Fearne's grandmother Morri Calloway , the Fatestitcher. The Exandrian location seems to be the central focus, with the other two being supplementary, but it is also the best guarded. Fearne is only slightly familiar with the Unseelie Court , and doesn't really seem to know all that much about her grandmother. But she remembers that when the Unseelie came after her parents, she was left with Morri because it was somewhere the Court was unlikely to look.\n\nWhen Ira Wendagoth and his lack of loyalty to any faction is mentioned, Ryn suggests that that chaos might work in their favor. However, Morri seems like their best bet, if they can avoid the time distortions of the Fey Realm. Fearne is excited at the idea of the party visiting her home . Imogen casts Sending to Morri, saying that Fearne wants to come visit and asking if Morri can get them back without time \"wibble-wobbles\". Morri responds in a terrifying hag-like voice that it's nice to hear from her and tell Fearne to come visit. \"I can help... always.\"\n\nFearne is thrilled, but they remember they need to pick up Ashton in Yios. Ebenold and Baryn decide to stay with Ryn, for safety, for a while, and Ryn Plane Shifts them back to the cellar in Yios from which they departed. As Chetney runs up the stairs, he hears crashing from above and quickly shuts the secret door. They hear a strange voice telling another to \"smell them, then find them\".\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e43-axiom_shaken"}

There, you found a ruin of some sort of a military tower, and with the information that you had received from Ajit Dayal , you, Chetney , in seeking the Gorgynei , the sect of blood hunters that focus on controlling the beast of lycanthropy within, the group has stopped at your behest. Here, you howled at dusk in hopes that they would hear you. And hear you, they did.\n\nAlong this journey, you did make a sending stone call to our good friend Dorian , who did reply, retroactively:\n\n“\nOh, Orym, my heart aches that I cannot be there to help you. Find strength. Stay steadfast. Sending you fairer winds.

Here, you were introduced to a number of the civilians that also lay under the protection of the Gorgynei, themselves carrying the lycanthropic curse. Upon discussing your interests, the short time frame you have, and the recent unexpected control over your transformation that the ruddy moon Ruidus previously did not have, you are guided to the possibility of undergoing a trial within a specific location not far from where they stay known as Zha'Vrollo , the Temple of the Savage Heart. It is believed that Sahyaadon , which is one of the numerous bestial spirits that claim part of this landscape their home and their domain, resides there. It is a holy site in which the Gorgynei have taken it as part of their own meditations and rituals and various important training activities in dealing with their own challenges.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAs the party settles into the portable hole for the night, Chetney is stoked and eager for the coming trial. They talk about what were-creature each would be, if they could choose: Ashton a \"heavy reptile\", Orym a rabbit, Imogen a horse, Fearne a quokka or capybara , Fresh Cut Grass a bass, Laudna a rat (a were- ROUS ), and discuss the mechanics of becoming a lycanthrope .\n\n![Fearne and mushrooms - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/02/Fearne_and_mushrooms_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/275?cb=20221212142735)\n\nIn the morning, joined by the group from Barinak , they set out on their journey to the temple of Zha'Vrollo . Fearne samples one of the mushrooms growing along the path and learns it has psychedelic properties, poisoning her for the next 24 hours. Although they encounter five massive twilight tigers along the way, when the Gorgynei and Chetney take their hybrid forms, the tigers slink away. When evening approaches, they set up camp. Experimentally, they have FCG sample one of the mushrooms but it has no effect. FCG, however, asks the still-high Fearne for her insight into his new relationship with the Changebringer , and she reaches out to the deity on his behalf. Her altered senses hear the voice of a small black beetle with a human face, saying, \"Hi,\" before it flies onto her forehead and she feels a warm hug. The others just see the bug fly onto her face.\n\nAfter dark, Annaline takes Chetney into the jungle and asks him to show her what he's learned. He transforms and demonstrates his Rite of the Flame, but she is unimpressed. She asks his motives for wanting to learn their secrets and he admits he wants to help make the world a better place. She warns him that the constant battle against their wilder nature can be exhausting, but he is undeterred. She shows him the basics of \"glyph work\", a more advanced blood hunter ability, which will in time allow him to expand on the basics of hemocraft.\n\nIn the morning, they set off again. Fearne's high wears off around midday, and in the afternoon, Manad shares some information about the temple and Chetney's coming trial. When they reach Zha'Vrollo , Annaline warns them to be respectful and ask permission if they take anything. Everyone looks at Fearne.\n\nThe party and their escort cautiously enter the partially collapsed, rock-carved interior of the ruined temple and the Gorgynei light the wall-mounted braziers and sconces inside. In the center of the main room is a statue of Seraatani , the Wildmother. Annaline and the other Gorgynei leave offerings at the feet of the statue, telling Chetney to do so as well. He is then to meditate and communicate with the spirit of the temple, Sahyaadon .\n\nAs they settle in, they sprinkle ball bearings in the entry hall in case beasts enter from outside. The Gorgynei form a perimeter around the edges of the room as Chetney sits cross-legged in front of the statue and addresses Sahyaadon, asking for any wisdom they could share and saying he'd like to do some good, at times. A few hours pass with no response. Eventually, the sunlight fades, replaced by a moonbeam - although Chetney realizes Catha is not at the proper angle to produce it. He catches sweetness in the air, with an underlying scent of decay and iron, and feels a presence arrive.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThere is a faint vibration in the ground, and Fearne notices movement in the falling water. Chetney suddenly begins feeling emotions that aren't his own and his mind fills with images. Without words, he can sense questions piercing to his heart. An eerie voice asks if he is hunter or prey. Chetney responds \"Hunter\", but is told he is both hunter and prey. When he then answers he seeks freedom rather than indulgence, he is told he is a fool. The final question comes: Does he seed the garden, or spoil the earth? Chetney is at a loss, but chooses spoiling, and is told he is a catalyst. When his eyes close, he can see a red flare beneath his lids, and the entity tells him it will take a part of Chetney, and leave a part of itself within him. Chetney unhesitatingly accepts the trial.\n\nAll the Gorgynei stand, close their eyes as one, and a pale blue mist drifts from them. Chetney feels his red tether to Ruidus being tugged, and the urge to give in to his feral side becomes overwhelming. The trickle of water into the chamber becomes a full waterfall gathering around him with mist and water, and his body transforms into wolf form, but much larger and more frightening than ever before.\n\nAs initiative begins, the party is unsure what to do. Imogen casts Fly on herself and attempts to contact Chetney telepathically, but feels a wave of ancient will that shuts her out. The others hesitate, but on Chetney's turn, he hears a voice saying, \"Sunder. Tear. Devour.\" He obeys, attacking Fresh Cut Grass and Fearne, and reducing Little Mister to zero hit points, causing him to vanish. In his new form, Chetney has massively improved abilities, including legendary actions and resistances, three attacks, and greater speed. The party reluctantly begins attacking him in self-defense.\n\nOrym runs forward, holding out a half-carved wolf he was planning to give to Chetney and trying to persuade him not to attack. When his persuasion roll succeeds, Chetney feels shooting pain in his head and sees a red flare. Red smoke begins trickling from his chest. The rest of the party attacks him while trying to talk to him, and he uses his legendary action Howl of the Hunter to frighten Ashton and Orym. Fearne eventually turns into a sexy wolf and tries using persuasion on Chetney as well, and Chetney permanently loses one of his three legendary actions as his fury slows. Laudna , using Spider Climb , skitters across the ceiling and casts Darkness over the hole there to block the moonlight streaming through. With that, Chetney shrinks to his normal werewolf form.\n\nWith Orym clinging to him, Chetney dashes toward Laudna but Orym  asks him what he's doing, and Chetney fails his Wisdom save. For a moment, he regains control of himself before the ancient power takes over again. The others begin trying to use spells or words to convince Chetney to stop his attack, but without success until Ashton tells him to knock it off and succeeds in intimidating him into obeying. Suddenly, Chetney realizes what he's doing and drops his wolf form. Ashton walks up to him, softly saying, \"C'mere,\" and punches him in the face. \"Asshole!\"\n\nNo longer held by the spirit, all the Gorgynei begin laughing. Chetney pulls out the dagger still stuck in his chest, but the blood stays in the air like a red mist as the Darkness spell mysteriously drops and moonlight once more streams into the chamber. The voice of the spirit once more fills Chetney's mind: \"I eat of the scar of an unworthy predator, and leave my scar in its place. You are a hunter, and the wilds wait with you to be unleashed.\" Red energy drifts out of Chetney's chest, forming into the faint shape of Ruidus before it dissipates.\n\nManad tells Chetney the test is different for everyone, and Chetney apparently needed to deal with tensions with his allies. Although Chetney can still feel the presence of Sahyaadon , it is no longer within him, and the tension he has felt since Ruidus flared is gone. Laudna Mends his ripped clothing with Pâté 's help. Relaxed and happy, Chetney suggests they all run naked through the woods, and the others follow him as he dashes out, shedding clothing as they go.\n\n![Serataani's gift by Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/46/Serataani%27s_gift_by_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20221213101959)\n\nOrym hangs back, watched by Fearne. He catches a faint, familiar scent: Will , his husband. He turns, and it seems for a moment to be coming from the statue of the Wildmother. He thanks her, and notices small vines growing from the top of the sheath that the statue clutches to her chest. Leaping up, he sees a small opening in the top of the sheath. Taking out his heirloom shortsword from Zephrah , he slides it into the sheath and the vines begin growing around and surrounding it. There is a faint green light that slowly fades. His hand also wrapped in the vines and ivy, Orym pulls the blade out. Ivy now grows from its hilt, wrapping around the blade like a hand guard. Emerald magical energy drifts from it. Orym bows his head, saying, \"I don't know why but I'm grateful all the same. Thank you, Serataani .\" With that, he runs out following the others. Fearne goes to the statue, and taking out a platinum coin, flicks it toward the statue saying, \"Hey, thanks. That was fun. Bye!\" before also running out.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e41-call_of_the_wild"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E46-Night at the Ligament Manor","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells , after making it to the city of Yios , the City of Flowing Light, gathering some information, losing Ashton for a bit, regaining Ashton (who had one of their own separate adventures that is continuing to reveal itself), interrogating a member of the Ruby Vanguard that seems to be working alongside or under the strange Ruidus endeavor that Ludinus , Otohan , and Liliana all seem to be tied up in. Going to the Seminary finally, had some conversations with the professor about the origins of FCG , learning a little more about themself, while Fearne and Imogen went to find the professor that you've been searching for for quite some time, and one of the main reasons for coming here at the get-go.\n\nUpon speaking to the professor and learning a bit of information about the Grim Verity and some of the work they're doing and have been doing as well as what seems to be happening underneath Ludinus's interests, Ludinus Da'leth arrived within that office, took the remaining elements of the Omen Archive that had been long hidden, and seemingly robbed the professor of the majority of their awareness and intellect for the time being. After a brief conversation and being left to your devices, Ludinus just left with the pages he needed. You called in the rest of your troop, you gathered the professor, called Planerider Ryn , who you had befriended and allied your various plans with, and decided that your next order of business was to search out one of these three machines, these \" keys \" you've heard them referred to as, one of which exists in the Fey Realm .\n\nAs such, you were transported by Planerider Ryn to the Fey Realm. After wandering through the dark swamps of an area called the Harrowcall Fens , you eventually came to the exterior of the Ligament Manor , the home where Fearne spent most of her life under her Nana , this strange, alien, vine-covered massive treehouse that you walked up within and were greeted by the somewhat nightmarish monstrous form of Nana, both faces and all, as she invited you to have a cocktail at her tiki bar.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nNana welcomes them into her odd and off-putting home , filled with both taxidermied and living creatures. She makes drinks as Fearne introduces the party. When Imogen greets her telepathically, she can hear seven or eight whispering voices within Morri's mind. Morri asks and receives permission to touch Ashton 's head, and as she does, a dull blue glow from inside follows her finger and there are vanishingly quick flashes of half-memories. Morri pours their cocktails, which smell like citrus swampwater, but they all drink and realize they have acquired darkvision for the next eight hours.\n\n![Peepers - ZioCorvid](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b6/Peepers_-_ZioCorvid.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230130230453)\n\nFearne and Morrigan both express how happy they are to see each other and how much they've missed each other. The party tells Nana everything. As they chat, an odd rabbit-like creature jumps up and Fearne happily introduces Peepers . She then announces to Morri that she has a child, and brings out Mister to be introduced.\n\nMorri asks about the Weave Lens she made for Ira Wendagoth , and they assure her it worked. FCG asks her what she charged for it and is told it was the return of a favor. Morri spends most of her time watching others. She's not a master of fates but \"can add a tangle or two to the skein\" if she chooses. She's aware of the Malleus Keys , and when Ira is brought up again, asks if he said anything about her. She invites them to spend the night.\n\nMorrigan doesn't know much about Ruidus beyond that it is a red moon that recently appeared in the Fey Realm , and she knows that the Key that Ira built is somehow connected with it. The Unseelie Court has been building up their defenses around the Shiver Keep where the device is kept. Imogen asks if Morri could help with the issue of time passing when they return from the Feywild, and is told she may be able to help focus the transition to make it less random. She also gives them the location of the Malleus Key within the territory of the Unseelie Court and recommends they ask Ira for more information. She and Laudna bond over their shared interest in crafting and taxidermy, and Laudna introduces Pâté . Morri and Chetney bond over the wooden furniture, and he is in awe that the tree grows the wood into these shapes for her. She tells him passion and enthusiasm like his is one of the things she collects.\n\nWhen Morrigan grows tired, her second face takes over the conversation. They are told Fearne was gifted to Morri for safekeeping, but Morri will have to check if an exchange of favors was involved. She tells Fearne to show the party around, and Fearne leads them to her bedroom which has painted skin curtains and a cage over the window. Outside, they can see a glowing red orb in the sky drifting in front of the distant mountains. Fearne then goes to ask Nana if it's okay to show the party the Collection, and she agrees. The room contains thousands of objects of all kinds, mostly horrifying and nightmarish. Morri claims the objects come to her; she doesn't like to travel. People come to her asking for things, she takes her price, and places it in the room. Ashton gives her the magical statue from the portable hole [1] that assumes the face of the person looking at it, but when it is confronted with Morri, it struggles, then cracks. Morri promises to repair it and sets it aside.\n\nAshton asks her about the sensation he experienced when she touched his head, and when she does it again, there is a burst as they see, an inch outside Ashton's head, a small disc of dark clouds that immediately shuts. Morri pulls her finger back, saying she doesn't know what it is and doesn't like it: it holds magic both very old and very new. To show Morri something \"weird\", Ashton takes her outside, rages, then goes into hyper rage and moves 180 feet in six seconds.\n\nMorri goes back to sleep and Fearne takes them to the garden at the top of the tree, holding incredibly detailed, dense topiaries that Fearne claims she made, from plants, but when Orym gets close to one he can hear a very faint, very slow heartbeat. Suddenly, a massive talking sun bear named Sweet Pea approaches and greets Fearne and the party joyously, and is disappointed she's not staying permanently. Fearne leads them to a vardo, where they'll sleep.\n\n![Imogen and Laudna sleeping - cvleart](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/de/Imogen_and_Laudna_sleeping_-_cvleart.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230131132720)\n\nNow alone, Imogen fills in the party about what they learned at the Seminary, including the Reilora . She notes the resemblance between their description and the creature she summoned when casting Summon Crimson Shade . [2] They decide to try sending FCG and Laudna into one of Imogen's dreams with her. Imogen and Fearne also tell the others about Ludinus Da'leth and his theories. Imogen isn't sure the gods really are that great, but one person shouldn't be controlling the fate of so many, and there's no guarantee Predathos would stop with destroying the gods. The consensus is that they need to stop Ludinus's plan. They decide to sleep, and FCG casts Shared Dream on Imogen and Laudna as they go to sleep holding hands. In the darkness of her sleep, Imogen sees a tiny speck of red that beckons.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nImogen moves closer to the red glow and discovers it is a portal elsewhere. Two orbs flank her as Fresh Cut Grass and Laudna accompany her. Through the gateway is a strange forest bathed in deep red light, with scattered mountains, glowing red from beneath. When Imogen turns back, a portal-sized semi-ethereal Ruidus is right there, as if she had just stepped out of it. When she approaches the gate thinking of her mother , she goes through into the familiar dust storm landscape of her dreams. As she focuses on her mother, she feels a pull and follows it, eventually reaching a wide, deep pit with evidence of construction all about. Descending, she sees the building is taking place among ancient ruins. In the center is a massive tower like a three-pronged fork curling into itself at its apex, and at its base is the Malleus Key surrounded by hurrying shades, some with a faint red glow. One of them is clear: a woman with deep lavender hair, Liliana . Imogen approaches and touches her, and Liliana stops and says, \"You shouldn't be here. You have to go.\" Imogen feels everything stretch and pull away. FCG reaches out to her and is pulled away with her, and Laudna is able to wake herself. Imogen realizes this means they could have been being spied upon this entire time, but alternatively, she could possibly spy on others. Eventually they go back to sleep, although Laudna wakes still exhausted.\n\nThe next morning, FCG bakes scones (which grant temporary hit points) and gives them to Chetney , Laudna, and Imogen. They bid farewell to Sweet Pea and descend the tree to find Morrigan , who gives Fearne three Harrowcall Veils which will help them remain unseen, if not moving, in shaded spaces of the Fey Realm , and a Gloomscale Breastplate that once belonged to a princess. Morri makes them another round of the darkvision-granting cocktails and tells them the closest gate to their world is where the brambles knot to the left of the location they seek. She warns them to beware of the Festertree Blights, who have a \"rusted\" sense of humor, and \"if the ground grows wanting, be sure to pay it the iron tithe.\"\n\nFearne remembers to ask Morri whether Fearne was given to her as the repayment of a favor, and is assured she was left with Morri by her parents to keep her safe because the Unseelie know better than to approach Morrigan's domain. The few who have tried now adorn her garden. Morrigan tells Fearne she is welcome to stay with her, if she wants, and let her friends handle the situation. Fearne is tempted, but decides to go with Bells Hells , promising Morri to return later. Morri asks Fearne, if she sees Ira again, to tell him he's an ass. Asked about the Unseelie, Morri describes wild nomads who just hunt, fight, and deal; cruel, regimented court soldiers; and eternal, ominous politicians and generals. She advises them to consider using methods other than fighting when dealing with them.\n\nThe party bids her farewell and pushes into the fens and swamps surrounding Ligament Manor once more, guided by Fearne and Imogen feeling the pull of Ruidus. Suddenly, Orym hears wings fluttering and a tiny voice calling, \"Fearne!\" FCG screams as the sound of wings flapping grows closer but Fearne and Ashton hold him back as Fearne happily greets Dr. Nesbitt , another friend from her past, an owl-like bird who sets off mutual jealousy with Mister but decides to join them to help. Eventually the landscape shifts to become muddier and Fearne asks Dr. Nesbitt to go home so he stays safe.\n\nAfter a few hours, they reach a valley and break out of the trees. The red Ruidus-orb is visible, smaller than normal and lower on the horizon, sitting above the far end of the valley. The valley itself is filled with twists of brambles dotted with small lights, and the sky is more shadowy in a continuous twilight.\n\n![Imogen casting Command 2- Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/53/Imogen_casting_Command_2-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230130231137)\n\nMoving on, they hear galloping hooves approaching and try to hide, but FCG disturbs a steam-releasing plant and their yelp of pain draws the creatures' attention. FCG is immediately confronted by three longbow-armed centaurs , who begin speaking in Elvish . FCG casts Tongues and is shot at and missed by one of them, but now understands they've been saying, \"Do not move,\" and responds, \"We mean you no harm.\" The centaurs realize there are others present and search them out. FCG claims they are Morrigan 's friends, but the centaurs only laugh and waken one of the trees. Imogen Commands them, \"Don't!\" Chetney pulls out a small carved version of Ligament Manor and FCG translates Chetney saying Morrigan will love having new statues for her garden, but it fails to intimidate the centaurs.\n\n![Wild magic Fog Cloud - @cpprcoyote](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe party gathers that the centaurs are trying to capture them and sell them to the Unseelie Court, and they attack, hitting fairly easily. Ashton manages to knock one centaur unconscious immediately. When the centaurs attack, they hit only Imogen for minimal damage. Ashton destroys the animated tree before it can attack, then knocks out a second centaur. The three women then team up for a combo move on the only remaining centaur, giving them advantage on their spell attacks. Had one missed, they all would have, but since all succeed, they gain extra damage and the How do you want to do this?\n\nThey search the centaurs, discovering they are hunters loosely affiliated with the Unseelie Court and occasionally working for them under contract for profit. Imogen realizes her wild magic triggered when she cast, creating a Fog Cloud around her. They walk on, leaving the unconscious centaurs behind with their arrows broken, and reach the end of the swamp and beginning of the bramble forest at the edge of the Sablecast Grounds , the location of the Malleus Key .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e46-night_at_the_ligament_manor"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E48-An Exit Most Fraught","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after traversing across planes to the Fey Realm , in transit to destroy one of the Malleus Keys that had been constructed and prepared by the Ruby Vanguard under Ludinus Da'leth in preparation for the coming apogee solstice , a climactic celestial event that promises to bring an apex of magical power and change to Exandria . You've come through after meeting the long-spoken-about Grandma Morri , Nana Morri, of Fearne , began to walk amongst the various unexpected dangers and odd encounters here on the darker side of the Fey Realm, infiltrated the Shiver Keep, where one of these Malleus Keys lies. After spreading out amongst the interior of the courtyard and finding a means of destroying the Malleus Key, sending it exploding and left in a tangled mass of metal and flame. You also called the attention of the Sorrowlord Zathuda , riding atop his fey dragon, his Gloamglut .\n\nYou began to flee the courtyard of the keep into the forest outside, heading westward, more or less, from where you attacked this Key, in search of the gate you were told would lead you back to Exandria, but in the process, sustained some blows. Fearne, you were knocked to unconsciousness, and you hear the screeches above of the now-angered Sorrowlord and his mount flying above the forest searching for you, his current prey.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Zathuda and Gloamglut by Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/12/Zathuda_and_Gloamglut_by_Lap_Pun_Cheung.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20230208180023)\n\nThe party is huddled under their Harrowcall Veils at the edge of the forest as Gloamglut and Sorrowlord Zathuda circle above. Guided once more by his Changebringer medallion, Fresh Cut Grass casts a Healing Word to bring Fearne back to consciousness. Imogen uses Catapult at doubled distance to pick up an object far away from them and throw it even further away, drawing the attention of the flying fey dragon and allowing the party to stealth away, still pursued not only by the dragon but by Unseelie war bands. A beam of black flame cuts through the forest from above, hitting Laudna and FCG and knocking Laudna out, but FCG immediately casts Cure Wounds on her.\n\nChetney sounds the Horn of Silent Alarm , temporarily drawing Gloamglut away, and they run at full speed through the rough terrain and thread the needle through the Faerie Fire casting towers. When the sound of wings grows nearer, they hide under the veils, and move quickly when the dragon is further away. Imogen steps into sucking mud and her iron tithe of her caltrops is insufficient. Laudna's ball bearings and Orym 's dagger are accepted however, and Imogen is further wounded but escapes.\n\nImogen Sends a message to Nana Morri , telling her where they are and begging for help finding the portal, but ominously, there is no response. Orym climbs a tree and sees the beginning of the bramble patch that is their destination. He points the proper way and they run until the wings approach again and they hide. As the dragon curves back toward them, a massive hawk-like creature slams into its side and brings it down into the forest. Taking the opportunity, the party runs full tilt, hearing the sounds of the two fey creatures battling in the distance. Imogen burns a tunnel through the brambles with Lightning Bolt but before they charge in, they see parts of the aerial battle above them and the bird creature with the neck and face of Nana Morri taking a black lightning hit and crashing into the forest.\n\n![Terrosh - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/ab/Terrosh_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20230213152142)\n\nFearne is sure Nana will be fine and they dash through Imogen's tunnel. Eventually they reach a nightmarish arch formed from a dark, twisting tree split down the middle with a door of rolling fog. A nest-like construction is above the door, and a creature who introduces itself as Terrosh the Lidless Slumber descends and demands a toll. Terrosh speaks in rhyme and the party quickly realizes they must do the same. Ashton offers a thimble they stole from Fearne and their rhyme is acceptable, so the creature pushes Ashton through the portal, but Imogen's rhyme is so fumbling that her pot holder is not deemed sufficient. With each failed rhyme, the creature grows larger and more threatening. Orym, Laudna, and FCG succeed and are pushed through the portal, but the sound of the pursuing dragon's wings grows louder. Chetney succeeds with a miniature rocking horse and Imogen barely squeaks by with one of the Harrowcall Veils . That leaves Fearne, who offers a skeleton key which is accepted and she is thrown through the gate just as Gloamglut arrives.\n\nThe party finds themselves in a jungle-like forest, which Imogen recognizes as having trees similar to those in the Taloned Highlands in which she grew up. They notice that the portal, from this side, appears to be a waterfall. Laudna climbs a tree and recognizes they are in the Highland Bluffs about 35-40 miles from Imogen's hometown of Gelvaan . Imogen is very reluctant to visit, pointing out there's nothing useful to be learned there, it's two days travel to reach, and they have less than two weeks till the apogee solstice . She and Laudna share a bit of the story of how they met a few years earlier in Gelvaan when the townsfolk attempted to violently remove Laudna.\n\nThe party decides to take a short rest to clean up and recover spells. Laudna recalls Pâté as well and Ashton gifts FCG some cooking ingredients they stole from the kitchen of Ebenold Kai in Yios . Imogen then Sends to Planerider Ryn , who responds that other Grim Verity allies are currently trying to destroy the Malleus Key in the Shadowfell . Ryn is at the Hellcatch Valley Tishtan excavation site where there are many of the Ruby Vanguard , and Imogen asks if she can come pick them up. Ryn agrees, as soon as she finishes her current scouting mission. But her message abruptly cuts off with a whispered, \"Shit!\"\n\nWith that means of transport apparently cut off, Imogen eventually agrees to head toward Gelvaan with the hopes that Captain Xandis and their skyship can pick them up either there or before they reach it. She Sends to Xandis, who agrees to meet them there. Since it's now night, they make camp and throw the bodies of the Unseelie guards still in the portable hole through the portal with a note saying that they're a snack. Chetney assumes wolf form and goes hunting.\n\nWhen everyone else is asleep, Orym asks FCG if he's okay. FCG admits he's been a little on edge lately, but Orym gently presses. FCG says he has a new clarity and feels like there's someone out there helping him. He's given up on learning more about his past and he has to build his own future. He admits that earlier that day he was hanging on by a thread, very close to losing control again. He feels like he's a big question mark, but Orym tells him everyone feels like that. He himself isn't sure of his place in the world and doesn't understand what's happening. But the world may end in 13 days, anyway, although FCG's sure everything will be fine.\n\nThey all settle in for a long night's rest.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nIn the morning, Imogen Sends to Morrigan the Fatestitcher and confirms she's all right after her battle with the fey dragon . FCG Sends to Xandis , learning they're a day and a half away.\n\nThe party sets out for Gelvaan , traveling uneventfully. That night, Imogen and FCG cast Sending to Ryn , but there is again no response. They decide to try to send Imogen scouting in her dreams, accompanied by Laudna , Chetney , and FCG . Before falling asleep, Imogen (at Orym 's request), sends an update to Keyleth that the assassins are at an excavation north of Yios , planning to kill a god for the solstice . Keyleth responds that the Ashari are currently beneath Terrah where the rift to the Elemental Plane of Earth is in danger, possibly related.\n\nFCG casts Shared Dream and they all go to sleep. Imogen focuses on Ryn and the excavation, and finds herself dreaming of the red storm again. She moves forward, accompanied by the others in the forms of floating balls of light, to a pit in the earth with excavation equipment at its edge. The excavation is busy, with both humanoids and two hulking armored guardian automatons that they have not seen previously. Imogen explores cautiously, following a sense of being pulled toward Ryn, and telling the others to wake up if they see Otohan Thull . They descend into the pit, seeing ancient ruins and ghostly figures moving throughout.\n\nImogen continues to a massive fork-like towering structure that she had noticed previously in the center of the excavation, that has been built upon more recently. There are three more massive automatons and dozens of other shadowy humanoids all working on moving its power cores to further belowground and more separated. It appears they are retrofitting the construction based on the destruction of the Malleus Key in the Fey Realm , since this spire appears to be being built as a key as well. Imogen gets the sense this is the centerpiece of what's coming. She also notices a figure standing at its base, and she feels the pull toward it. As she very cautiously approaches, she can make out the figure of Planerider Ryn, hand out, frozen into stone.\n\n![Otohan in Imogen's dream - Sabira Langevin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d4/Otohan_in_Imogen%27s_dream_-_Sabira_Langevin.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230213195340)\n\nChetney and Laudna urge Imogen to leave, but FCG drifts over and inspects one of the automatons first. He notices for the first time that the machinery being built around the tower has an odd familiarity for him. He also suddenly notices a flash of glowing eyes near and a female figure looking in his direction. Imogen tells him to wake up, now, but he hears Otohan's voice saying she knows him, and is filled with a cold sensation, unable to move. Laudna and Imogen succeed in waking, but Chetney and FCG do not. Otohan approaches FCG, saying, \"Well then. Punishment it is.\" He and Chetney feel piercing pain in their minds and wake up screaming.\n\nThe dreamers report to the others what they saw and they speculate on what it might mean, guessing that the purpose of having keys operating in the Fey Realm and Shadowfell might have been to strengthen this central one. It's possible its purpose is to break or unlock the Divine Gate -like latticework around Ruidus . Chetney urges Imogen to visit her home in search of any information that would help her convince her mother to help. They eventually go back to sleep and complete a long rest, although FCG and Chetney awake with a point of exhaustion.\n\nIn the morning, they reach the busy main road and by mid-afternoon are in Gelvaan , and spot their skyship approaching. As they move through town, Imogen and Laudna are recognized but the townsfolk give the party a wide berth, added to when Ashton sticks close to Laudna and makes eye contact with each person they encounter. They reach the sprawling Faramore Estate and ask for Imogen's father . Relvin greets her warily but agrees to talk about her mother ; he always knew this day would come sometime. He shares that Liliana concealed her powers from him and left when Imogen was between one and two years old. He hoped that it was because she wanted to protect her daughter and initially hoped she'd return, but gave up that hope after about ten years. Imogen begs her father for any information that might help pull Liliana back, but he hasn't seen her in almost twenty years and doesn't know what she might be like now.\n\nFearne asks if he has anything that belonged to Liliana, and Relvin silently walks out, followed by Imogen. As they walk to his home, she recognizes the landscape of her red storm dreams. He enters, rummages a bit, and pulls out a small box. It holds a silver chain with an oval locket impressed with a child's fingerprint and the inscription \"The better halves become a better whole.\" Relvin warns Imogen not to get herself into the same trouble as her mother, and tells her she should leave town soon since her prior farewell has not been forgotten and the tales have grown with retelling. She telepathically tells him, \"I never want you to be afraid of me, Daddy.\" Relvin wishes her luck, pats her shoulder, and starts to ask her to tell Liliana something, but stops himself and goes back inside the home, closing the door.\n\nImogen returns to the group, pretending everything is fine. The skyship is descending, drawing the attention of all the townsfolk, until it lands just outside the town gates. The rest of the party acts as though Imogen is terribly important and they climb aboard. Once everyone else is aboard, Imogen faces the crowd and flies up onto the ship, to general awe. The skyship takes off, doing a low circular pass over the town before heading off north toward the Hellcatch Valley . Imogen clasps the locket around her neck as she stands on the deck, while Orym notices a faint aurora barely visible in the sky.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e48-an_exit_most_fraught"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E54-Treacherous Toys","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: In the wake of the strange cataclysmic event that seemed to occur in Marquet at the behest of Ludinus Da'leth , Bells Hells has been divided and suddenly scattered to the four winds of Exandria , with FCG , Chetney , Fearne , and Imogen finding themselves in the Crystalsands Tundra , journeying towards Uthodurn , where they gathered two new friends, Deanna and F.R.I.D.A. , some with some history with some of the group they encountered. Upon returning to the town and beginning to figure out that other strange enchantments and magics have been altered about this solstice and still continue to reveal the impact of this event, one of which happened to be some sort of incursion or attack at the depths of Uthodurn itself.\n\nWith the gathered soldiers, Glassblades and royal sentinels, at the ready, they closed the massive gates to protect most of those that could escape, including the king and queen , and you all, rightfully, without a second thought, jumped in after your heroic Aeormaton here, trekked into the citadel itself and encountered the terrifying, massive, bull-like beast that had been freed from its long-standing petrified prison. After a brief absorbing of its terrifying attack brunt (mainly you, Fearne ), you eschewed combat and instead attempted to contact this entity and ascertain what was agitating it. After managing to calm it down and convince it that you were not enemies, you walked it through the center of the Augur Trail in front of the populace of Uthodurn and set it free once more into the open air of Exandria in search of the forest from where it once came many, many years ago. Most of you, at least. You stayed behind in the throne room and stole a bunch of shit, and then escaped through a tunnel, covered yourself in blood, and then gave yourself to the protectors of the realm within the city to help bind your wounds.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party (minus Chetney ) return to the city and find themselves heroes, and invited to a formal recognition by the King and Queen the following day at noon. They realize Chetney is missing and Imogen suffers psychic damage when she attempts Sending to contact him. He is still below, his fake wounds being lovingly tended to by rescuers, and makes his way upward through the city where he reunites with the others. They go to Deanna 's home, a small, cluttered, cozy two-bedroom. When Chetney proposes sharing one of the two beds with Deanna, she is flustered and heads outside, joined shortly by Imogen. Deanna confesses that Chetney has changed -- he used to be driven, focused, and passionate. Imogen assures her that she still has a special place in his mind.\n\n![FRIDA's dream by Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/4b/FRIDA%27s_dream_by_Cha_Cha_Rae.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/375?cb=20230409104741)\n\nFor the night, the women share Deanna's room, Chetney sleeps on the couch, and FRIDA and FCG share FRIDA's art-work-filled room. FCG casts Shared Dream as FRIDA falls asleep and joins them in their dream, seeing Exandria as a globe and a vision of FRIDA as a humanoid with legs and a child at their feet. FRIDA feels as though the child has a name they should know but cannot remember, but cannot actually see it and when questioned by FCG, wants to wake up. FCG wraps their arms around FRIDA and they wake together, with FRIDA immediately trying to draw the child from FCG's description. This has unlocked FRIDA's memory that at one time they were supposed to protect this boy as part of their duty, and Deanna's laugh reminded them of him. FRIDA feels a faint itch in the back of their head at the thought of the boy.\n\nIn the morning, Deanna cooks them all breakfast and they head to Oltgar 's store, now renamed \"D&O Toy Emporium\". Chetney explains that Oltgar was a brilliant master craftsman of fine wooden toys, and Chetney was his second for years before \"a son of a bitch elf named Drixlitch came in and fucked everything up\". Chetney isn't at all sure he'll be able to restrain himself from attacking when he sees him. They establish a safe word: \"parmesan\".\n\nWhen they reach the store, they find that as well as being renamed, it has a second story and its appearance is enhanced with magic as well as metal decorations, and bright turquoise and purple paint. It appears closed and shuttered, and a small crowd of employees is gathered anxiously outside. The door suddenly opens and a singed hired orc guard barrels out, shouting that he quits before stomping off. A portly, white-bearded dwarf in a deep red coat that the invisible Chetney recognizes as Oltgar wonders anxiously what they're going to do now. Fearne asks what's wrong and he explains that they've recently begun doing a lot of business in magical toys, with their best-seller being imported enchanted whizzle-cages, used to hold pymon firebugs as nightlights. When the cages lost their magic in the Apogee Solstice , the firebugs were freed and have now taken over the store.\n\nOltgar's partner and the majority owner of the store, Drixlitch Ovana approaches and introduces himself, explaining that along with toys made by Oltgar, they also outsource their production to other talented creators throughout Exandria. He hires them to battle not only the firebugs inside, but also his rare pet craskkalid , a cute-looking glow worm used as the mascot on the store's sign, which has left its larval stage and is now much more dangerous. It is in his room on the second floor. He offers the group a total of 500 gold pieces to clean up both the firebugs and the craskkalid, although he would like at least some of the firebugs left alive but contained. Fearne convinces Oltgar to pay them 500 gold apiece, and Drixlitch gives them the key to the bedroom.\n\nAs they enter, Chetney drops invisibility to start a Crimson Rite, while FRIDA accidentally-on-purpose kicks Drixlitch's cane and pickpockets his whole keyring in the ensuing confusion. When Drixlitch leaves, Chetney sneaks next to him and slices his calf slightly with his chisel, using a Brand of Castigation. Imogen reads Oltgar's thoughts and learns he hates Drixlitch, who has crushed the spirits of all the workers in the shop. Deanna offers his some breakfast (kept warm inside FCG), which he gratefully accept. The party enters the shop, Chetney sneaking past Oltgar unseen.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nInside, the shop is slightly singed but brightly decorated with modern toys. Although everyone else thought Oltgar was sympathetic, Chetney is still angry at him. Suddenly, about a hundred glowing coin-sized pymon firebugs swarm into the space and hang near the ceiling, buzzing. Deanna communicates with them using Speak with Small Beasts and attracts them to her, aided with some honey. They find a small wooden box, move the honey into it, and attract about half the swarm there, but Chetney realizes the firebugs like to eat wood plus they grow warm enough when agitated to potentially set wood on fire. Imogen uses Telekinesis to move all the beetles into a compact ball and Fearne attempts to create an Air Bubble around them, but it pops and the now-agitated and flaming firebugs attack.\n\nImogen is able to contain those in the room they are in with Telekinesis again, but FCG discovers that an adjoining room holds more firebugs. A Shatter from Chetney (using Turmoil ) takes out about a third of them but the party learns that the more the insects are attacked, the hotter they get. Deanna tries to calm both swarms by casting Blindness on them, but it only seems to make matters worse, and a third swarm appears from upstairs. FCG uses Compulsion on one swarm, while Imogen uses Telekinesis to move one swarm into a Snare created by Fearne, removing it from the battle and holding it safely. FRIDA gets the final hit on another swarm with Guiding Bolt , but Chetney discovers two more upstairs and turns into a werewolf . Fearne casts another Snare and FCG uses a Spiritual Weapon in the form of a flyswatter to knock the last downstairs swarm into it. Moving upstairs, Imogen uses Telekinesis to move a bench and squash one swarm with it, and FRIDA wipes out the last swarm with their blunderbuss.\n\n![Deanna and the craskkalid - SavsCreates](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/19/Deanna_and_the_craskkalid_-_SavsCreates.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230413164257)\n\nThat leaves the craskkalid . There is a locked door upstairs that Chetney suspects may be Drixlitch 's. Although Imogen points out they have the keys, Chetney breaks down the door with his scythe . Inside, there is a litter of organic material like an opened cocoon but they see nothing. Experimentally, Deanna casts Dawn , lighting the room up and exposing the giant multi-legged insect on the ceiling, which is damaged by the radiant energy and drops to the floor, attacking.\n\nThe creature has multiple attacks that hit hard and can grapple with its claws, but the party is able to quickly damage it significantly. When it begins bleeding, those close to it are also subject to fire damage from the blood. Fearne is grappled, but FRIDA wounds it enough to make it drop her. Fearne then casts Polymorph on the creature, turning it back into its cute, tiny larval stage. Fearne then proposes enticing Drixlitch back into the house to \"deal with it\". They search the room and the desk, finding receipts tying the shop to child labor sweatshops in Shadycreek Run , and documents forged in Oltgar's name that would bequeath the company to Drixlitch if Oltgar died. Chetney points out if they leave the baby there to kill Drixlitch, it could also kill others, including Oltgar.\n\n![Fearne and the craskkalid - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/bc/Fearne_and_the_craskkalid_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230410131126)\n\nFearne swaddles the worm like a baby and holds it. The others search the room, finding prototypes for mechanical toys, an enchanting kit, and some fingerless gloves. Chetney realizes through his Brand of Castigation that Drixlitch is over a mile away. He asks Imogen to help him talk to Oltgar and she agrees, but won't help him kill him. They all suddenly realize Fearne is still there with the worm and tell her to run to the entrance as the Polymorph is approaching its time limit. Once outside, she throws the worm down a small cliff but it transforms back into adult form and pursues her. The city guards see her frantically running toward them and shoot the creature, killing it. Meanwhile, the rest of the party safely stores the snared firebugs in secure metal boxes.\n\n![Oltgar with Chetney - Jenny Dolfen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOutside, Chetney confronts Oltgar, who still bears the scar of Chetney's attack. Chetney half-heartedly apologizes for stabbing him, but is still angry that Oltgar forgot the value of their craftsmanship. He tells Oltgar that Drixlitch is screwing him over and shows him the documents they found. Chetney suggests Oltgar sell everything to Drixlitch and go elsewhere to start fresh, creating classic toys. Oltgar denies knowing anything about the child labor and admits he has lost his way. Maybe he and his employees would be better off starting over somewhere else. He has messed up. Chetney tries to bring himself to forgive him, but Oltgar cuts him off, saying he doesn't deserve it yet. Chetney suggest he go buy eight or nine goats and a used sleigh, and Oltgar replies that he thinks maybe he should make toys for all the kids of Exandria. Fearne suggests heading north, and it sounds good to Oltgar. At Chetney's request, she burns Oltgar's desk. FRIDA gives Chetney some scraps of fine wood they scavenged earlier from the wrecked furniture.\n\nThey all travel down the Auger Trail toward their noontime appointment with the King and Queen of the Diarchy of Uthodurn .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e54-treacherous_toys"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E56-By Goat or By Boat","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Half of Bells Hells and some new companions have traversed the interior of Uthodurn , righted some challenges that arose in the reverberations caused by the Apogee Solstice and the events that occurred under Ludinus Da'leth in Marquet . In doing so, you gained the favor of the Diarchy of Uthodurn . You dealt with some of Chetney 's past within the toy store that he once worked within, and upon trying to learn a bit about your histories as Aeormatons , in doing so found a common friendship and bond of emotion or beyond.\n\nAfter speaking with the king and queen of Uthodurn and asking about Ludinus, you discovered that indeed Ludinus existed within the city of Molaesmyr , where most of the elves who lived within this city and joined the dwarves here in Uthodurn fled from it in its destruction, as well as learning that, within the ruins there, perhaps there may be remnants of his past within the city, as he had the Gildhollow Tower that he resided within before its destruction and fall. Since you have no means of escaping the continent at the moment, as nobody with the capabilities of teleportation has returned since the Solstice began, you've gathered yourselves some flot goats and you've begun your trek towards the Savalirwood , in hopes of uncovering some information.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Cold Imogen - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/25/Cold_Imogen_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230425215921)\n\nThe party sets off southwestward through the Flotket Alps . Ruidus remains out of sight, but the ley lines are still visible long after the three days that the Apogee Solstice should have lasted. The first two days are uneventful, but on the third day a blizzard causes Chetney and Imogen to become exhausted. FRIDA gives Imogen their coat, and FCG then gives FRIDA his coat.\n\nOn the fourth day, they encounter two frost giants , but after a brief fight are able to flee and reach the Ivory Lake . The Boreal Omen River flows outward toward Molaesmyr to the southwest, and FCG proposes making a goat boat by lashing the flot goats together as a raft. Fearne uses Speak with Animals to discover that her goat Donnie Boy is okay with this as long as they don't get wet, so they alter the plan slightly to building a small raft from logs. FRIDA asks Deanna to put her Death Ward on FCG and Deanna does so after interrogating FCG as to his intentions toward FRIDA. FCG then asks Deanna her intentions toward Chetney and she replies that she thinks there's something between him and Fearne.\n\nThe raft completed toward nightfall, they camp for the night. FCG casts Commune , seeking the Changebringer , asking if she is real. The light around him shifts and he sees a figure at a distance, her hair blowing around him, present but distant. She has been watching him. He thanks her, and asks if she needs help. After a pause, the answer indicates that she does, but moreover, so do the other gods. FCG shares his vision with Deanna, who assures him the Changebringer sounds like a great god. Fearne encourages Imogen to try to reach Laudna through her dreams, but since she's exhausted they decide tonight isn't a good night for it.\n\n![Exploding Goat - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/35/Exploding_Goat_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230425220407)\n\nIn the morning, they try to load the goats onto the raft but discover it is much too small for them. Deanna immediately kills her goat, Jerry, harvests its wool, and Chetney carves up the meat. Imogen is horrified. Trying to come up with alternatives, Fearne speaks with Donnie Boy again, who is terrified by Jerry's slaughter and doesn't want to explode himself. Fearne urges the surviving goats to stay where they are and wait for them and the party sets out on the raft down the river and into the shadowed depths of the cursed Savalirwood .\n\nChetney shares that he's been in the Savalirwood before. It was where he was bitten and transformed into a werewolf . FRIDA realizes that Chetney bit them the first night they met and is worried that they may now become a werewolf as well. Imogen assures them that if they do, they can help cure them, and also asks if Deanna's just up and killed an animal before this. FRIDA says she hasn't, and frankly, it alarmed them. FRIDA then wanders back to FCG, who tells them it will be all right.\n\nThey continue floating down the river till nightfall, surrounded by the sounds of the increasingly living forest around them, and see tiny blue lights moving among the trees. Eventually they hear a heavy slapping sound and deep croaking, and see small white motes of fey energy that are revealed to be pixies swarming around a larger host entity lumbering through the wood. Deanna casts Control Water , trying to hurry them through this area, but their lights draw the creature's attention, and it suddenly leaps into the water ahead of them.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Rafting - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3b/Rafting_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20230427160636)\n\n![ZioCorvid](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe creature attacks with tentacles and tongue, hitting hard, biting, grappling, and being able to pull a target toward and into its mouth, but the party is able to do significant damage hitting back. However, the swarming pixies also attack the group, Polymorphing Imogen into a fox. Almost immediately, an attack by Deanna breaks the pixie's concentration and Imogen is restored. FRIDA chooses to be hit by the creature's tongue and pulled toward its mouth, where they are shortly joined by FCG through his grapple cannon. The rest of the party continues to attack the bog wretch , damaging it seriously, but it swallows FRIDA until they fire their blunderbuss from inside it and wound it enough to be vomited out into the river. Finally, Chetney casts Shatter , hitting both the bog wretch and the tree above it, and the combined damage finishes it off. The party climbs back aboard the raft and the pixies are chased off with a Tidal Wave .\n\nIt is now growing late and in the darkness they debate the wisdom of continuing traveling. Fearne uses Speak with Animals and asks an eyeless fish swimming by about upcoming waterfalls or other dangers and learns that there are no waterfalls but lots of dangerous animals and that they should avoid the Wolf-King . With the Aeormatons taking turns to keep watch, the rest of the party sleeps. Midway through FRIDA's watch, Deanna wakes and asks them if they want to be a werewolf, because they seem oddly excited at the prospect. FRIDA doesn't not want to be, because it looks like fun, but Deanna points out Chetney was also scared he'd hurt FRIDA. Unexpectedly, FRIDA asks Deanna to pray with them, and offers a prayer to the Dawnfather thanking him for bringing these people and specifically Fresh Cut Grass to them. FRIDA tells Deanna it wasn't important before, but they now want to protect the group.\n\nMorning comes and the party wakes, and the day is uneventful as they float on. The next day, half a day from the river fork near Molaesmyr, they begin to notice small cracks in the ground emitting dark energy and terrible smells: a miasma that is believed to be an extension of the original corruption. Suddenly, a geyser opens up and sprays them with the miasma, affecting Fearne and Deanna, exhausting them and lowering their maximum HPs. Eventually, FRIDA notices a tower in the distance that appears man-made.\n\nThey pull over to the riverbank and drag the raft ashore, heading toward the tower and eventually seeing other towers, leaning at odd angles. The ground has heaved into hillocks and cracks from which drift more of the dangerous miasma, and as they reach the outskirts of the city they notice odd webs or nests in some of the trees. They can hear a sound of wood on wood coming from somewhere deeper within the ruins. Taking stock, they decide to have Imogen cast Summon Crimson Shade and send the creature into the ruins to explore.\n\n![The Elk Creature - Odd](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAs the crimson shade moves northward, they hear clacking sounds approaching. A massive featureless multi-legged elk-like being charges from an alley, slamming into the shade and destroying it. It looks about, then pulls its way deeper into the ruins with human-like arms and hands. Suspecting the creature was drawn by sound, FCG casts Telepathic Bond so that the party can communicate silently. They continue stealthily moving into the city, occasionally seeing ghosts from the corners of their eyes, egg sacs hanging from the buildings, a thick growth of brambles and vegetation, and the bones and bodies of the former inhabitants who failed to escape the creeping corruption.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e56-by_goat_or_by_boat"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E60-Faith or Famine","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: The other half of Bells Hells , which found itself scattered to another part of Exandria , had crawled their way in the middle of the night out of some sort of a massive gorge of geothermal activity and dangerous spraying bits of steam and acid-like liquid materials, upon which you began to wander into the nearby forest in hopes of finding some semblance of civilization. Along the path, you stumbled across one , and then two , and then a third new companion along this journey, each with their own unique form of chaos they bring along with them. Upon getting to know each other a little bit, as well as discussing who's friend, who's foe, what needs to be done, and where you might even be, you found yourself assailed by some of the natural dangers that exist in the surrounding forest. During this battle, some rose to glory, others laid down and pissed themself. But nevertheless, a first ragtag scuffle between newish companions led to a modest victory.\n\nAfter setting up some previously-stored corpses as their own animatronic warning sign through the evening, you camped out within a nearby cavern, rose with the sunrise, and gauged where your next destination should be, here on the far off continent of Issylra . Now that you've gathered your things, you've woken, packed your materials, tools, and whatnot, as the light grows brighter in the sky above the tree line of the forest that surrounds you, you had seen a bastion of civilization a little under a day's journey by foot, hopefully, from where you now stand after getting a decent view from above the tree line.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe group discusses how to proceed. Prism suggests that if they can get access to a Scrying spell for her to use or copy into her spellbook she could check on their missing friends. They head toward the signs of civilization Orym had spotted and Laudna guides them to a well-traveled road, which Dynios identifies as the Outerwalk leading from Othanzia in the northeast through the Demithore Valley where they are currently. The town of Endovaar is further west, and Hearthdell is east-northeast in the direction they had been traveling. They decide Hearthdell sounds friendlier. Laudna sends Pâté ahead to scout, joined by Prism's Mother , and they set off on what promises to be a full day of travel.\n\nAlong the way, they pass a fork in the road where they find the remnants of a gallows, surrounded by uncarved gravestones. Orym notices that a lot of the earth in the area looks disturbed, and they decide to give the area a wide berth. About an hour before sunset, the magic users of the party notice a strange charge in the air from the rising arcane energy surrounding the leyline nexus almost immediately overhead as they reach the village of Hearthdell . After a brief reconnaissance, they enter cautiously.\n\n![The Temple of the Dawnfather in Hearthdell - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/97/The_Temple_of_the_Dawnfather_in_Hearthdell_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230611185213)\n\nThey are eyed suspiciously by the townsfolk, and noticed almost immediately by an apparent guard of some kind wearing the symbol of the Dawnfather . Bor'Dor approaches Hender , a very old man, and they ask if anything unusual is happening in the village. He shushes them as the guard confronts them, asking their business and destination, and sending them on their way while continuing to watch. Ashton buys some tobacco from Hender, and Bor'Dor gives him some jerky, and he warms up, telling them the village lost \"a few\" people during the Apogee Solstice but they should talk to Proleff or the elder Abaddina for more information.\n\n![Orym with Laudna - Maddy Marshall](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/06/Orym_with_Laudna_-_Maddy_Marshall.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230604235717)\n\nAs they proceed through the village, they notice the people are more quiet than would be normal, and they see more of the uniformed guards. The central square holds a very large temple of the Dawnfather , and Prism suggests that clerics know the Scry spell so that should possibly be one of their stops. They also try to make Laudna look a little less undead with Orym's Druidcrafted flowers and Deni$e 's makeup.\n\nEventually they head first to the Innovar Apothecary where Proleff , the herbalist, tells them the village had 11 people vanish during the Apogee Solstice the previous night. The village had thrown together a makeshift celebration after having been forewarned by the temple of the upcoming solstice. The temple had also sent several \"specialists\" to \"keep an eye on things\" because of the village's proximity to a leyline nexus. Nervously, Proleff tells them of the new temple guards and the Judicators that had arrived from Vasselheim . He admits the village isn't traditionally religious but celebrates the spirit of the landscape. They are of the Loam and the Leaf, which the temple considers to be pagan, and the people have been occasional targets of Vasselheim missionaries. Several years ago, the wealthy Silvercall family from nearby Endovaar bought land in the village and arranged for the large Dawnfather temple to be built, which has created a certain discomfort within the community. But the elder Abaddina handles communications with the spirits of the area, and can be found at the Knotburrow in the Arklune Fields. He also shares the legend of a continuing curse on the gallows at the crossroads, and the details of the maypole celebration the village held the prior night.\n\nThe group walk-and-talks to Abaddina's home, Knotburrow, with the members of Bells Hells bringing the newcomers up to date about the events of the Solstice, the involvement of Ludinus Da'leth and the Cerberus Assembly , Grim Verity 's theft of the texts discussing Predathos ' destruction of the lost gods Vordo and Ethedok and subsequent imprisonment within Ruidus , and Vasselheim's concealment of these facts. Deni$e points out the irony that this town, Hearthdell, is being oppressed by religion while the party was trying to save the gods from destruction by the release of Predathos during the Solstice.\n\nThey reach the Knotburrow and knock. Two vines descend, serpentlike, and inspect the group before a peephole in the door opens to reveal an eye. An old woman's voice asks what they want, and they explain they were transported here yesterday during the Solstice and have been told to seek advice from her. They are friends of the Loam and the Leaf. The vines around the door loosen and it opens, revealing a very tall half-giant woman. Orym Druidcrafts a large white flower and presents it to her, and she accepts it and invites them in.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party enters Abaddina 's exotic home, telling her they've been told to seek her out. They are looking for access to a Scrying spell and need to get back to their homes. Abaddina is suspicious but notes if they were spies they'd be better at it. She introduces herself as a soothsayer and protector of the people of the village, a guide and spiritual advisor who can speak to the Demithore Eidolons , the spirits of the land. She asks what they think about the Prime Deities , and Deni$e , Bor'Dor , and Prism are quick to express their disapproval of them. Orym , however, points out that some of the gods have done a lot of good in the world, although he's not a very religious man, and that the local problems may be an over-reaction to the recent threats against the gods.\n\nAbaddina produces pink spores in her hand and blows them toward Orym, who agrees to inhale them. He suddenly finds memories flooding through his mind, Abaddina experiencing them with him. She tells the group that the temples of Vasselheim seek to rob the people of their freedom. While Laudna agrees, she points out that destroying the gods would leave a power vacuum that others would fill, possibly even being worse than the gods themselves. Abaddina argues that sometimes things must crumble before being rebuilt better, and she can sense that someone with vision has made the gods afraid, the first mortal to do so since the Matron of Ravens ascended. Orym tries to tell her that Ludinus is evil, but she still believes his goal is a good one. She agrees to help the party if they help her free the village. They should come to a meeting at the brewery in 15 minutes. Deni$e respectfully asks her to prove she can actually help them, and she leads them to something resembling a bird bath: a scry well, which is still working.\n\nThe brewery is filled with anxious villagers who are suspicious and angry about the activities of the temple, the Sunrise Sanctuary. Elder Abaddina addresses them, telling them they all heard the voice during the Solstice, and it is time to arise. Most (though not all) of the villagers are enthusiastic and step forward. Ashton argues that they have committed themselves just by being there, and one by one the party also steps forward to join the fighters, Orym with resignation rather than enthusiasm. Abaddina tells the fighters about two hidden pathways leading to the temple. When they arrive there, they will give those within a chance to leave voluntarily. There are about 6 armored bastions within the temple, 3 on the other side of the village, plus Flameguide Kiro , the head of the temple, and two judicators . Bor'Dor proposes taking some tobacco and a barrel of beer to the temple to distract the guards, while Orym proposes offering to share information about Da'leth's plans and actions with those within the temple, to convince them they would be more useful on the front line in Marquet than here. Prism suggests she could summon a demon to further distract the guards as a last resort. The villagers head out taking the secret paths to the temple, while Bor'Dor and Orym go directly and openly there with their offerings for the guards, the rest of the party staying hidden. The signal to attack will be the words, \"That's unfortunate.\"\n\nOnce at the temple, they are challenged by the guards but Bor'Dor convinces them to accept the offerings. However, he surreptitiously pours some of the laxative he bought earlier into the guards' beers. Once they've drunk them, Orym tells them he comes from the heart of the threat they fear and he wants to help them do what they need to support the Dawnfather. One guard goes to tell the Flameguide. While he's gone, Orym notices the mist around the temple shifting slightly as though with consciousness (the Eidolons aiding) and the bushes and trees around it begin to grow. In the shadows, he can see the waiting villagers. The hiding Prism realizes she is missing the component to cast Summon Greater Demon , but casts Invisibility on Mother and sends her in to scout the temple. Mother sees the guard talking to a tall armored figure who has apparently been doing research, and one of the Judicators.\n\nThe Flameguide appears on one of the towers high above, irate and suspicious. Orym tells her he comes from Zephrah , and the foremost mage of the Cerberus Assembly is trying to tear the gods from the sky. Where they all, including the forces of Vasselheim, need to be is in the Hellcatch Valley of Marquet , fighting against Da'leth, not here, but his words fail to convince her. She orders both Orym and Bor'Dor taken to her superiors in Vasselheim, and as the guards move forward, Orym gives the signal: \"That's unfortunate.\" Orym then uses Seedling 's vines to throw the guard with them into the wall. Pointing his sword at Kiro, he tells her they need to figure this out, now, but she just shouts for the temple to be locked down.\n\nPrism Manifests the Mind next to Orym and Dimension Doors both her and Deni$e inside the temple into the room with the Judicator as the battle breaks out and the villagers charge forward.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e60-faith_or_famine"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E51-The Apogee Solstice","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , upon travelling all across Marquet in search of a number of varying threads, have watched them converge as are the various ley lines towards this nexus point on the northeastern side of the Hellcatch Valley , here, above an ancient ruin that has been partially uncovered by one of the nearby academies and then taken over by the Cerberus Assembly (specifically Ludinus Da'leth ) in preparation for the Apogee Solstice , which is nigh. You've all taken your airship , the Silver Sun , to this location, divided your troop along with some allies you brought up with the crew of the ship. You have on the ship, currently waiting, your second team, which is FCG , Fearne , and Ira Wendagoth , the Nightmare King. They are standing by at the ready, while the rest of you have begun a slow infiltration of this sunken pit of an excavation site.\n\nAlong the way, you encountered a couple of members of the Ruby Vanguard . You defeated them, partially disabled one of the massive automatons that they were using to guard the space, and encountered two other individuals that were also in the process of scoping out and infiltrating this: Beauregard Lionett and Caleb Widogast . After a brief conversation and aligning your interests and goals, some information was traded and your groups scattered out amongst the region of this excavation.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nBack aboard the Silver Sun , Fresh Cut Grass and Fearne are growing anxious. FCG Sends to Orym , asking their progress, and Orym responds they could use some help jumpstarting a robot . After discussion, FCG and Fearne decide to entrust Captain Xandis and Ira Wendagoth with crashing the skyship into the Malleus Key at the proper time, while Fearne and FCG join the rest of the party there. Just before they leave, Ira confides to FCG that he thinks the Malleus Key is missing a lens.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party decides to take a short rest. They are approached midway by suspicious patrolling guards but are able to convince them the fallen Warder simply malfunctioned. As their rest completes, FCG and Fearne join them and they all exchange information. FCG is able to connect himself in the place of the Warder's fried power cord, gaining control over it, and they are able to crowd all of the party into the Warder's chest cavity except Orym, who is carried in the Warder's hand, and Imogen who remains outside. They approach the pit itself, lined with the grisly trophies of Paragon's Call , and descend one of the ramps leading downward. Imogen Sends to Keyleth , asking her to arrive in one hour, and Keyleth responds, agreeing.\n\n![Inside the Warder - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/87/Inside_the_Warder_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230315120806)\n\nAs they descend, they encounter two figures coming upward. One is General Ratanish , who asks Imogen what she found. Orym Druidcrafts red berries and smears their juice on his face, playing dead in the hulking automaton's hand as Ratanish inspects but does not recognize him. As Ratanish sends Imogen on, he warns her there are rumors of more ships on their way to attack from Vasselheim . Warder-FCG (carrying Orym in one hand and most of the party in his chest) and Imogen continue downward, watching workers load hundreds of Potions of Possibility into four subsidiary towers around the central Key. Imogen notices Otohan Thull among the workers there, having fresh potions added into her backpack before disappearing into a freshly-cut side tunnel, and also spots the petrified body of Planerider Ryn . Further on, Imogen notices her mother Liliana leap from a catwalk high above and drift downward slowly, then help the workers by telekinetically shifting a large piece of armor plating into place.\n\nAt the base of the pit, FCG and Imogen walk over to a quiet side alcove, passing the broken body of a Judicator that was apparently thrown in. Once there, they discuss strategy and decide to try exploring and destroying what they can along the way. The first alcove they come to is too small for FCG to enter but Imogen can see a rapidly-descending cavern within. Laudna sends Pâté ahead where he finds multiple arcane power sources connected by residuum tethers.\n\nImogen, Ashton , Orym, and Chetney descend and she tells the three guards they're needed above, but they're suspicious and flank the group. Orym attacks one, knocking him prone and getting in front of Imogen. However, the guard casts Hypnotic Pattern affecting both Orym and Ashton, freezing them in place. Imogen recognizes it as Exaltant energy. Chetney counterattacks with Turmoil but is hit and wounded by the two others. Imogen telepathically tells FCG to join them before casting Psychic Whip , causing the wounded enemy to drop concentration on his Hypnotic Pattern and freeing Ashton and Orym. Laudna uses Pâté to cast a Shocking Grasp before Orym kills the Exaltant, Ashton rages and kills another, and Chetney intimidates the last into dropping his sword just as the rest of the party arrives to help.\n\nChetney questions the guard, learning that Paragon's Call requires their members to wear the symbol of the Duskmaven . Imogen asks about and learns there is a glyph trap on the ground right in front of the power array. Searching the fallen Exaltant, Orym finds a locket bearing a portrait of a little girl. Chetney investigates the power sources with an eye to disconnecting them from the grid.\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna checks the tracking orb attuned to Otohan Thull and discovers she is moving, while FCG, still outside the cavern piloting the Warder, sees Otohan move toward the cavern where the party is. FCG immediately Messages Laudna warning her.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party frantically prepares for battle. Still outside in the massive Warder automaton , Fresh Cut Grass sees two massive explosions destroy the machines emitting the periodic antimagic pulses. Otohan Thull immediately turns towards them, but Imogen releases a Psychic Lance without seeing her. Otohan uses a Legendary Resistance to succeed on her save but is unable to tell where the attack came from and runs towards the explosions, away from the party. FCG Sends to Ira Wendagoth , telling him it's time for the airstrike. Meanwhile, the others work at exploding the power cores and eventually succeed in significantly damaging and disconnecting them.\n\nOutside, FCG sees two flashes of magical energy produce a 12-foot-tall armed golem and Ludinus Da'leth . In the chaos caused by the explosions, FCG moves casually to the petrified Planerider Ryn but when he attempts to pick her up he accidentally knocks a wall down onto her. Ludinus, annoyed, deactivates the automaton FCG is inside.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashton quietly kills the third guard, and as they leave a thoughtful Orym takes the locket he found earlier. While leaving the cavern they encounter two searching guards but are able to pretend to be guards themselves, saying the power array's compromised. They all hear Otohan's voice in their heads, bidding everyone at the site to gather at the Key. As they move forward, they see a crowd looking up at Caleb Widogast falling, then stopped in mid-air, seized around the back of his neck by the claw of a mage hunter golem , and Liliana floating down behind him. They can also see Beauregard Lionett walking calmly down a spiraling ramp, controlled by Liliana, before she is chained and gagged.\n\n![Ludinus ascendant - Natalie Chenard](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a1/Ludinus_ascendant_-_Natalie_Chenard.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230313122550)\n\nStanding on a ledge midway up the Key, Ludinus spreads his arms and addresses the two captives, telling them they will have front row seats to see what they have failed to prevent. He also bids the crowd to dig out Planerider Ryn, whose right arm has snapped off. Ludinus says that too many entities are drawing close, so their timetable is being accelerated. He places one hand into an opening in the Key, causing the residuum along the spire to glow as he fuels it with his own arcana. At his signal, Liliana causes the armored sides of the spire to drop, revealing within it a small dodecahedron . As the device powers up, time seems to stop and then accelerate around them as hours pass in seconds until the red moon is directly above them. Ludinus removes his hand, now dark and withered, then looks up as the Silver Sun suddenly falls at high speed toward them. He throws up one arm creating a Wall of Force that protects them and the Malleus Key as the skyship explodes into rubble.\n\nThe party is able to see that Xandis and Ira Wendagoth escaped the ship before it exploded. Laudna asks Ira's advice to destroy the key, and he replies he'll see what he can come up with. Imogen Commands the golem to \"Release\" and it obeys, disconnecting, but its claw becomes a collar around Caleb's neck. With Orym's help, FCG is finally able to escape the deactivated Warder, but Liliana notices. As she lifts a hand, Imogen telepathically contacts and distracts her, saying, \"Mama. It doesn't have to be like this.\" She tells her she loves her, and the better halves make a better whole, begging her to remember. Liliana responds that she told Imogen to run, and that this is the only way to be free. \"We're its seeds, you and me. Why do you think we have this power? The Ruidusborn , the Exaltant ... it's been building a bridge and we're the mooring.\"\n\nSuddenly, there is an explosion deep below them: Ira has found a way to help, but Ludinus seems unbothered. Liliana, however, turns to look and spots Ira escaping. She casts Banishment on him and he disappears. Ludinus continues to address the crowd, justifying his hatred of the gods, and they can now hear the sounds of fighting above them at the edge of the pit, while Laudna and Ashton succeed in damaging another power source with dynamite. Liliana turns back to Imogen, telling her \"It's already done,\" and assuring her it will be all right. A dull red glow begins to emanate from the skin of all the Ruidusborn present, including Liliana, Imogen, and Fearne . Just then, a large boulder crashes down, slowly unfolding into the form of Earth Elemental Keyleth , casting Mass Cure Wounds around her.\n\n![The Champion defending Keyleth - MishellyArt](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/17/The_Champion_defending_Keyleth_-_MishellyArt.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230313121511)\n\nLudinus looks down on her and smiles, saying, \"Right on time\" as he successfully casts Power Word Stun on her. Otohan Thull and her three echoes surround Keyleth, unloading their attacks into her, knocking her out of elemental form and into her own body before any of the others can do anything. Finally, Otohan stands over her prone body, poised for a final heart strike, when in a whirl of black feathers the masked figure of Vax'ildan , Champion of the Matron of Ravens , interposes himself, standing over and protecting Keyleth's body, daggers in each hand, saying, \"Don't you even dare.\"\n\n![Orym vs Otohan - C3 intro](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFCG tries and fails to dispel Caleb's antimagic collar, while Orym attacks Otohan's backpack, damaging but not quite destroying it despite his desperate attempts. Liliana holds her action. Meanwhile, Chetney has climbed the Key to reach Ludinus. He transforms into his werewolf form and jumps onto Da'leth's back to attempt a grapple, but Ludinus cast Shield to avoid his grasp and Chetney falls onto a spike of the Key. Imogen makes one final attempt to persuade her mother, but fails.\n\nAbove them, Ludinus states: \"And now the final piece. The sliver of divinity, the lens.\" He reaches back into the device as Liliana uses her held action to cast a spell toward Vax'ildan. All the mirrors lining the pit light up, shooting hundreds of beams of energy into his body, causing him to scream in pain as he is compressed down into a sphere of dark shadow. Liliana uses Telekinesis to move the black sphere into the empty spot in the machine. Ludinus attempts to power it up, but there has clearly been quite a loss of power to the machine. Muttering, \"It'll have to do,\" he throws the final switch as they see a multitude of other skyships appearing in the sky above them, just as the red moon glows above.\n\nEvery Ruidusborn present is brought upright as the red energy filtering from them is drawn into the center of the spire, and forms into a sphere of energy at its top. A thick beam of red energy fires upward toward the red moon, blowing away the skyships as it reaches upward. Ludinus laughs as the converging power of the ley lines is drawn in and the sky goes from pitch black to deep red to a multicolor explosion of arcane energy, to white.\n\n![The Malleus Key activates - BlackSalander](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nLaudna's vision clears slowly, and she finds herself in an unfamiliar sulfurous rocky landscape, with Ashton next to her, surrounded by multicolored pools and small geysers. Orym is just above them. They are alone, and they have no idea where they are. But on the horizon they can see the red moon Ruidus connected to a red beam disappearing down behind distant mountains.\n\nFCG lands in soft, white, crystalline sand, maneuvering with difficulty. He is surrounded by dunes, the rising sun in the distance, and no moons visible. From the top of a dune he can see further: mountains to the east, a snowy forest south, and a line of ocean to the north, all far distant. He also finds Fearne, who seems normal. They shout for the others, and Chetney and Imogen hear them and come to meet them. Chetney suddenly realizes they are in the Crystalsands Tundra , and his home of Uthodurn is not far away to the east.\n\nAnd all of them can still see in the sky the shifting, glowing auroras of the ongoing Apogee Solstice .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e51-the_apogee_solstice"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E52-Far From The Others","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, half of Bells Hells : After heading towards the specific point of the leyline nexus that was gathering at the moment of the Apogee Solstice , your troupe happened upon an arrangement that Ludinus had been designing for quite some time, him and his compatriots in the Ruby Vanguard and Paragon's Call , and a number of other allies. He seemed to briefly alter time through some additions to this odd device , jumping you and other nearby individuals ahead to the solstice, therein which a number of other machinations came together to both bring your allies to bear, summon some individuals with utility to them, and in a handful of moments, seemed to successfully do what they were trying to do. Though how successful, we'll have to see, as you did quite a bit of damage to some of the energy sources and muck around with a bit of what they were plotting.\n\nBut, nevertheless, in those heightened moments, an extreme amount of magical energy was unleashed. In a flash, you found yourselves separated from your other friends, from everybody else, suddenly shunted far away from where you last were. Now standing in a freezing cold tundra-like snow desert of small beads of crystal and frozen snow that lie across these endless dunes, rocky outcroppings, and oddly shaped bits of earth that poke from the landscape as you see this endless, continuous snowfield that crawls out in all directions. You see in a northern direction a frozen ocean just barely visible as the sunlight begins to creep past the horizon. You see some mountains to the far east, forests to the south, and above you, in the darkened, slowly warming sky, you can still see the magnificent technicolor slowly shifting visual of the now-shifted leylines across Exandria , as still, the Apogee Solstice remains.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAfter a bit of panicked screaming and Fresh Cut Grass casting Calm Emotions , the partial party (minus Ashton , Laudna , and Orym ) tries to figure out what happened. Imogen doesn't think she did it, although the white flash they experienced was similar to the one she caused to end their initial confrontation with Otohan Thull . [1] Chetney can't smell any other of the party members, so Imogen casts Sending to Laudna but the message is overwhelmed by static and she suffers psychic damage from the attempt. FCG then tries, and although they don't suffer damage, the static defeats the attempt. Chetney shares that they're in the Crystalsands Tundra , west of his hometown of Uthodurn . From where they are, they can see the Flotket Alps and a gray smoke plume rising from Kravaraad , which orient Chetney to the location of Uthodurn, about equidistant from where they are to Palebank Village . Imogen tries Sending to Laudna again and FCG to Dorian , with the same failures, although their other magic seems to work normally.\n\n![Shoebill-Fearne - PryingBlackbird](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/84/Shoebill-Fearne_-_PryingBlackbird.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20230320184508)\n\nChetney guides them toward the mountains. As the day goes on, the cold seeps into them, causing Fearne to suffer a point of exhaustion. By the end of the day, they have reached the foothills of the Flotkets. Imogen cast Fly on herself and Chetney, Fearne transforms into a giant shoebill stork to carry FCG, and they fly forward, spotting a potential cavern shelter as night falls. Chetney investigates and smells no danger, so they enter. As they do, Chetney notices movement behind them, towards the entrance. Imogen senses thoughts just as a creature erupts from the ground: a massive cerulean lizard-like creature .\n\nDuring the battle, the creature's freezing breath causes massive damage to the group and they realize they are outgunned by it. Suddenly, Chetney notices more movement behind the salamander: two shapes running in from the entrance, and they hear a loud explosion. Aabria Iyengar and Christian Navarro join the group at the table, and their characters join the party in battling the creature. One is a tall emerald-green and rose gold aeormaton and the other is a female gnome wearing a symbol of the Dawnfather . Although slightly mistrustful, the party accepts their help against the salamander. They realize it is vulnerable to fire damage, but that fire damage also regenerates its deadly frost breath attack. The gnome cleric casts Mass Cure Wounds , giving the party a badly-needed boost in health, and they dig into doing damage, with Imogen's Lightning Bolt and Fearne's Scorching Ray finishing it off.\n\n![Meeting Deanna and FRIDA - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/4a/Meeting_Deanna_and_FRIDA_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/375?cb=20230320185233)\n\nHands raised, Chetney and Fearne announce they're friendlies, and the gnome introduces herself: Deanna . She and Chetney instantly recognize each other, although Chetney initially tries to deny it, but the others remember Chetney mentioning a former lover named Deanna... as well as a \"Frudell\". Deanna snaps that they don't talk about her, and her identity is confirmed when she walks over and slaps Chetney, who remains very flustered. FCG and the newcomer aeormaton recognize they are the same kind of being, and the newcomer, FRIDA , asks if FCG knows D , discovering they were both awakened by the mysterious merchant . The groups all introduce themselves to each other.\n\nThey talk a bit, and Deanna confesses that very recently she has felt as if the Dawnfather was leaning away from her. They decide to camp within the frost salamander cavern, and head together to Uthodurn in the morning. Fearne creates a fire and FCG asks about Chetney and Deanna. After their relationship ended, Chetney left and Deanna traveled to Uthodurn to see where he came from. There, she met and married her husband Dustel and had a family. However, she was killed in a creature attack, and her husband became an adventurer. After almost 200 years he was able to find a cleric of the Dawnfather who resurrected her about a year or two ago. Her family is now grown with families of their own, and her husband, Dustel, moved on after keeping his promise to bring her back.\n\nFRIDA explains that they were only recently restored to functionality by D, without any explanation or conversation. They made their way to Uthodurn, lost and confused, where they heard Deanna's laughter, and realized one of their primary functions in the past was to record. They now have recordings of everyone's laughter that they've ever met, but Deanna's was both unique and familiar, inspiring in them an urge to protect. FCG confesses he has learned his own past was the opposite, and believes he was created to gain the confidence of others before assassinating them. FRIDA shows them the words engraved inside their faceplate: Far-Ranging Integrated Defense Aeormaton, the acronym of which they named themself.\n\nFRIDA knows someone who knows about Aeor , the same person who installed their blunderbuss. His name is Jaquoby Macyl , and he lives in Uthodurn. FRIDA also realizes that despite attempting to project calmness about running into Chetney, Deanna is inwardly freaking out and wants to kill him. FRIDA walks over and gives her a little kiss on the cheek. When asked about the Dawnfather, Deanna explains she felt a connection with him when she was brought back. FCG explains he was given a coin of the Changebringer and that's how he chose to follow her, because he was looking for meaning or purpose in life. Without Dancer in his life telling him what to do, he needed something to help him make decisions. To demonstrate, he asks the coin if he's going to survive the night, and admits the result wasn't the answer he was expecting. Imogen is horrified that the whole reason he's aligned himself with the Changebringer is that he doesn't think he can find purpose on his own.\n\nAs they settle down for the night, Imogen goes outside to check the sky, and although she can see Catha , Ruidus isn't visible. FRIDA joins her, and she shares how worried she is for her friends and the rest of the world. FRIDA plays back for her the sound of her own laughter, and tells her it's beautiful. She needs to believe her friends are fine. Imogen goes back inside to sleep, but notices that the purple lightning marks on her body have spread further, and are beginning to turn red.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Deanna's Death Ward - Jenny Dolfen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nIn the morning, secretly, before Chetney wakes, Deanna casts Death Ward on him. The group faces about a day and a half of travel to reach the city of Uthodurn , but before they leave, Chetney creates a Minor Illusion of Orym so Deanna  can try Sending , but it fails again. Imogen temporarily removes the Circlet of the Hidden Eye and opens her mind, hearing the thoughts of all those around her with just the faintest bit of background static. FRIDA notices the marks on Imogen, now creeping up on her neck almost to her ears, and although Imogen isn't sure when the change began, she realizes they are turning to red in the places where they first appeared. FRIDA asks if Imogen is connected to Ruidus , and Imogen replies telepathically that she is.\n\nThey set off into the mountains and snow, and FRIDA thoughtfully realizes this is the first morning in a long time they have not been given the Death Ward . They volunteer to go first, but first FCG passes out mango bundt cakes he baked. FRIDA reveals that they can dream and the memories in the dream expand a bit each time. As they walk and talk, both FCG and Deanna become a little exhausted, but they continue to move stealthily through the mountains through the day and make camp that night in a small alcove.\n\nChetney seeks out Deanna, admitting it doesn't feel like 200 years and asking about her life. He shares that he left Uthodurn on bad terms. He had established a good toy woodworking trade selling through Oltgar in his shop on the Deliberation Disc, but \"a guy\" tried to fuck that up and Chetney might have stabbed him in the knee and Oltgar in the hand. He ran into the Savalirwood , chased by the Glassblades , and hasn't been back. Chetney starts to tell her he has fundamentally changed, but she cuts him off and hugs him, thanking him for being the first thing from her prior life that didn't hurt.\n\nChetney suddenly realizes that at the height of the continuing Apogee Solstice , Catha has become full and he feels his lycanthropy pulling at him. He quickly excuses himself and runs into the woods. Deanna is crushed and joins the others, wondering what she did wrong, but they tell her that Chetney is a werewolf . FRIDA asks if he'd harm them, and the others hesitate, wanting to defend him but not really able to. Fearne assures Deanna that Chetney was probably trying to protect her by running away. FRIDA asks if they're in danger traveling with the group, and Imogen and Fearne reassure them that they're really trying to help people. FCG, however, admits that they've been constantly surrounded by danger and things they don't understand, and he would understand if Deanna and FRIDA wanted to separate from them.\n\nImogen thinks back on how she felt during the moments as the Malleus Key was activated and the red mist began to surround her body, and realizes it felt for a moment like she was connected to something that had been missing her entire life. It felt fateful. Fearne also felt it, but to a much lesser extent. This leads into a conversation about those who are looking to remove the gods . FRIDA believes the gods are unnecessary, but Deanna wants to know what would replace them, although she, too, is deeply suspicious of them and views them as consumers of the power provided by the worship of mortals. The party tells them about those who are trying to release a god eater , which they realize puts them in the odd position of trying to protect gods they don't know much about. They admit they don't know if the god eater has already been released, leading Deanna to wonder if instead of feeling the Dawnfather leaning away, what she was feeling was his fear.\n\nThey realize that for two nights in a row, Ruidus hasn't been visible, which is very unusual. Fearne suggests trying to contact the rest of the party through Imogen's dreams, and they decide to try it. FCG casts Shared Dream on himself, Fearne, and Imogen, and Imogen concentrates on Laudna as she falls asleep. Instead, however, she is forcibly dragged into a dream of being pulled into the nexus of all magic now in Exandria, the column of red energy leading upward from the Malleus Key to the red moon Ruidus, locked in place as a bridge to the ground. Fighting against the pull of the magical energy being continuously drawn in, Imogen can see a slightly broken golden weave where the beam intersects the moon. At the beam's base, there is a faint red storm of dust swirling, with shadowy red-skinned figures within it. Fearne is forcibly shunted out of the dream, but Imogen is being drawn inexorably to the beam, attracted to its magical lure. FCG tries to anchor her as Fearne slaps her sleeping body. Finally, Imogen focuses on escape and both she and FCG wake up. FCG recognizes Imogen felt happy while she was being drawn in, but Fearne is indignant, pointing out that the others there were not people. Imogen wonders if perhaps her mother is among them now.\n\nMeanwhile, FRIDA goes out to look for Chetney, since he's important to Deanna. They follow the trail of dead animals, projecting Fearne's voice calling him, and Chetney hears it calling and responds. FRIDA also plays back, over and over, Deanna saying that this was the first thing from her past that didn't hurt. Wolf-Chetney is confused, the more so when FRIDA kneels and holds out a hand, asking him to come back, but the smell isn't right. Chetney tries to resist, but fails, and a battle begins.\n\n![Chetney vs. FRIDA - 6ix](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFRIDA fires their blunderbuss into the air, then starts running, which just excites the wolf more. Chetney is able to trip FRIDA, swiping at them, confused by the oil that seeps from the wounds rather than blood. When FRIDA rises, they charge at Chetney, who continues to hit them, eventually biting at the aeormaton, grappling but not damaging them. The rest of the party hears the shot and takes off running and Flying toward it, while FRIDA continues trying to talk to the wolf in Deanna's voice and eventually manages to shoot it once at point-blank range. Wolf-Chetney slams FRIDA to the ground, and FRIDA manages to shoot him once more. Now barely within range, the flying Imogen tries to cast Calm Emotions on Chetney but fails. However, the sounds and tastes of this creature are all wrong and Chetney is finally able to resist his wolf nature and run off into the woods.\n\nDeanna heals FRIDA while Fearne transforms into a shoebill, but Chetney is able to evade both her and Imogen's searches. Deanna is furious but FCG and Imogen calm her. FRIDA is taking it very well, assuring Deanna Chetney is still in there. They all return to their camp.\n\nMatt has Christian roll a Constitution saving throw: 10. And we'll end the session there!\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e52-far_from_the_others"}

In the middle of this magical detonation of some unknown source, you found your party scattered across Exandria , this half waking up in the Crystalsands Tundra on Wildemount , far away from Marquet where you once were. Along these snowy paths you encountered two companions that have joined you on this journey: one with a similar history as FCG as an Aeormaton , and one with a long history with Chetney Pock O'Pea .\n\nYou agreed to journey together — safety in numbers — to pursue the still not quite fully ascertained nature of the aftermath of this solstice and what Ludinus' plan was, heading toward the nearby elf and dwarf city of Uthodurn within the Flotket Alps . On the final evening of this journey, Catha is full, and you, Chetney, gave in to the wolven urges of your lycanthropy , raced out into the night while the rest of your group began to gently try to rest. At the behest of Deanna , F.R.I.D.A. , you went to seek this new unbridled wolven compatriot. You stalked him down, drew his ire, and the two of you fought in the middle of the night before this was stopped by the rest of the group catching up, at which you darted back out into the darkness, you wounded from the encounter, but eventually you all managed to return and recover.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAs the others settle in for the night, Deanna stays awake, waiting for Chetney to return. Eventually, he appears and apologizes, saying he had tried to tell her about his lycanthropy . He notices F.R.I.D.A. 's coat is torn and is very upset they were injured, but remembers very little of the night. Deanna heals him slightly, and Chetney admits he likes being a wolf a lot, but he doesn't think the people in Uthodurn will be happy to see him. When the others wake and question him, Chetney realizes the power of his curse has been elevated due to the continuing Apogee Solstice . FRIDA assures Chetney they feel fine and had fun during their fight, but Chetney feels guilty and promises it will never happen again. Deanna notices that a few of the half-healed wounds on FRIDA appear to be bites, and puts her Death Ward on the aeormaton before the group sets off.\n\nTowards late afternoon, they reach Uthodurn. Fearne is delighted by the flot goats kept by the local Glassblades law enforcement as mounts. When the Glassblades greet them at the city entrance, FRIDA is recognized and vouches for the party, but Chetney shares privately he may still be wanted there and he'd rather avoid the Deliberation (\"Liber\") Disk of the city. Deanna leads them toward her home on the Volition Disk, and as they walk they notice the city is darker than usual, with many of the magically ever-burning lanterns non-functioning and an air of general tension among the populace. FCG uses Detect Thoughts to learn the temples are currently closed and everyone is nervous about the dimmed lighting. There is a higher-than-normal Glassblade presence on the streets.\n\nImogen points out that they don't know what's happened in the past three days while they were traveling. She begins panicking that Laudna may only be kept alive by arcane magic, and if that's disrupted, she may be gone. Fearne hugs her in reassurance, and they decide to head straight to the Vellum Steeple (a for-profit library) to have research done and see what they can learn. They walk down the Augur Trail, eventually reaching and passing through the strong doorway that can be closed to bar the passage between the Volition and the lower and more industrial Deliberation Disk. As they travel, they pass Oltgar 's Chest, the shop of Chetney's former partner, and he notices it appears to have been expanded with a second floor. He tells Deanna and FRIDA about his disagreement with his former partner, and the stabbing incidents that drove Chetney to flee the city.\n\nWhen they reach the Vellum Steeple, the librarian is also tense because of the magical disenchantment that has occurred. At their request, he goes for Ressia Uvesic , the Scribewarden. When he leaves, Chetney casts Invisibility on himself and follows. The Scribewarden meets with the others, and they learn that the city's magical communication and transportation systems are completely down, and that the city hadn't even yet been able to learn if it was limited to Uthodurn or was also elsewhere. The party shares that they saw what they believe to be its origin on Marquet before finding themselves unexpectedly transported to the Greying Wildlands , and Ressia tells them that Divination magic (including Scrying ) is deeply diminished, with a number of older permanent magical enchantments also disabled, including teleportation circles and other transportation magic. This is unprecedented.\n\n![Ressia Uvesic - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/ba/Ressia_Uvesic_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230326160148)\n\nThe party decides that if communications are down, sharing what they know is that much safer, and they tell Ressia more, including that Ludinus Da'leth of the Cerberus Assembly is behind many of these events. Ressia explains the Steeple has already sent exploratory parties out via land travel on their way to Rosohna and the Dwendalian Empire , among other places. She is disturbed to hear that Keyleth , the Voice of the Tempest, may have been slain. She also shares that the loss of magic has resulted in the escape of some of the city's magically bound prisoners, and the party realizes that could also mean the release of bound ancient beings, powerful prisoners, or warded artifacts. Rexxentrum , the capital of the Empire and headquarters of the Cerberus Assembly, is a few weeks' journey away.\n\nSuddenly, there is a loud, shaking thump coming from below. Ressia hurries away, and the invisible Chetney observes other library users frantically researching. He is exploring an empty office when Ressia enters with two others that she assigns to research Ludinus before sending away, and Chetney escapes to rejoin the others. They go outside to explore the loud thud they all heard, and as they travel FRIDA suggests going to see Jaquoby Macyl soon since they might be able to use FRIDA's arcane power core as a battery for other arcane uses. They continue to follow the frightened crowd, finding them all gathered at the barrier door to the Grand Disk below. It is firmly sealed and guarded by the Royal Guards, some wounded. To its sides are smaller doors, and refugees from the Disk beyond are pouring through. In a small, well-guarded group to one side are several council members, Queen Simone Fruunast , and King Imathan Talviel .\n\nAnother loud thud hits the gate from the other side. FCG senses deep fear from the swarming guards, and FRIDA fires their blunderbuss in the air, shouting for the crowd to run. FCG takes off for one of the small doors, pursued by Chetney. FCG tells the guard he's been sent to fetch the Queen's lady-in-waiting, and with the aid of Fast Friends , he's convincing. The others, except FRIDA who is further away, run in after him. Trying to follow, FRIDA attempts to climb the chains over the gate, but falls. Imogen runs back to the small door and tries to convince the guard to let FRIDA in, but he grabs her instead. FRIDA charges through the now-open door, pulling Imogen with him. The guards slam it behind them.\n\nThey find themselves at the entrance to the Grand Disk, the bodies of dead and dying guards all around them. Questioning one of the wounded about what did this, she replies it was \"the statue\" from the Grandcast Citadel. It came to life and started killing, and she points to it wandering away down the roadway: a quadrupedal, hoofed, faintly glowing purplish-red beast. The guard thinks it is one of the Great Beasts of Veluthil .\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Umudara by Savs Creates](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f2/Umudara_by_Savs_Creates.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230326195655)\n\nCautiously, the party stealths after the retreating beast, lower into the Grand Disk toward the Grandcast Citadel, the seat of power of the Uthodurnian Diarchy . Around them, there are hints of movement behind darkened windows, as those who could not flee, hide. The creature seems to be returning to the Citadel, a massive horned bull emitting a soft reddish-purple glow, rippling with strength, but almost ethereal. They cannot tell if it's hunting, or just confused, but it eventually slowly walks inside.\n\nThey begin trying to rescue some of the hiding survivors, but their panic makes them noisy and they have to stop after about 20 people are escorted to the gate. Meanwhile, Imogen casts Invisibility on herself and creeps into the Citadel, finding more death and destruction inside. She follows the sound of the bull's hoofs upward to the heart of the building and a throne room holding two thrones, where the creature is pacing around a now-empty pedestal. When she opens her mind to its thoughts, they are completely alien but the emotions are anger, frustration, confusion, fear, and longing. She senses it is lost. There is a plaque on the pedestal but Imogen cannot understand its Elvish .\n\nImogen mentally contacts the others who stealth inside as well, but Fearne knocks over a rock drawing the creature's attention. FCG casts Tongues on themself while Fearne activates her Gloomscale Breastplate , but the creature hears her hooves on the floor of the throne room and turns toward her. Its form solidifies as it charges forward and gores her for massive damage, knocking her backward and prone. Getting to her feet, Fearne casts Dominate Beast on the gigantic bull and as it calms, she begins petting it. Imogen tries to communicate reassurance to it while FCG (using Tongues ) asks where it wants to go and promises they will help get it there. After a moment, the beast admits it doesn't know how it got here, and that it wants to go home, to the forest. Deanna is able to read the plaque: \"In memoriam of the fall of Molaesmyr .\"\n\nFRIDA assures the creature they understand being ripped from their proper place and time, and that they will help. The bull tells them that the people attacked it, so it just retaliated against them, and it's frightened. The party all are reassuring, calm, and friendly, and when the charm spell fades, the bull remains calm as well and asks them to show it how to get out. Its name is Umudara, and it was the Sentinel Beast of the Veluthil Forest .\n\n![Umudara - Clara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a1/Umudara_-_Clara.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230513010504)\n\nImogen and FCG run ahead to cast Calm Emotions and tell the frightened Uthodurnians at the gate that they're coming and that the beast won't hurt them. Imogen convinces the guards to open the gate and stand down, then tells the commander of the guards what they're doing. He agrees to tell his troops to back off, as long as the bull remains peaceful. With Deanna riding on its back, a bow from Fearne around its neck, and the others parading alongside it, they slowly walk upward through the city to the outside. In the early evening, they emerge, and the group points the bull in the direction of the Savalirwood and the ruins of Molaesmyr. It slowly walks off, trusting them.\n\nMeanwhile, Chetney has remained in the throne room, carving his initials into the bottom of the leg of the wooden throne and prying gems out of both thrones. Under a rug, he discovers a lever which when pulled, opens a door behind the thrones and a descending spiral staircase. Just then, he hears the soldiers reclaiming the now-safe palace, and wounds himself to have an alibi ready. Going down the stairs, he finds a long tunnel that emerges near the entry gate of the disk. As he exits, a soldier stops him, but sees his wounds and lets him go as the people around him offer help.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e53-ripples"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E58-Escape From The Past","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, this troop had wandered from the city of Uthodurn deep into the Savalirwood to the ruins of Molaesmyr in hopes of uncovering some of the lost history surrounding Ludinus Da'leth . After encountering some of the terrifying altered creatures that call it home, hiding through the ruins in shadow, only briefly managing to avoid being globally possessed by many of the spirits that linger here, running from the terrifying Wolf-King entity, and eventually climbing within the remains of the Gildhollow Tower, you clamber within the shaded ruins that once was the abode of Ludinus Da'leth. Within here, you begin to uncover some notes, some themes, and apparently  some sort of odd enchanted section of a wall. But before you're able to dig too deep into what that is and what it may contain, Chetney climbs the ceiling to check for others and in doing so seems to call forward or awaken some sort of strange amorphous creature that emerges and slops down into the center of the chamber.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Hatemonger mini](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/33/Hatemonger_mini.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230513164350)\n\nBattle begins as the gargantuan creature oozes down into the top-most room of the tower, its moist appearance shifting as if it were trying to assume a firmer form. The weird noises from its multiple mouths inflict psychic damage on those within melee of it, and it has legendary actions and resistances. Imogen runs for the stairs, falling to their bottom and firing a Lightning Bolt as she falls. Although the bolt misses, it starts a fire on the other side of the room, which continues to grow during the fight. The creature, a Hatemonger , then blocks the stairs, leaving Imogen cut off from the rest of the party.\n\nAlthough the Hatemonger is fairly easy to hit, it hits very hard, reducing Fearne to unconsciousness with a halved Constrict attack and a critical Consume, then swallows her. She immediately fails a death save, but F.R.I.D.A. is able to reach into the creature's mouth and pull her out, then cast Spare the Dying , stabilizing her. On the creature's turn, it spews out black miasma, hitting Chetney , FCG , FRIDA, and Fearne, and costing Fearne another failed death save for two total. The creature then slithers down the stairs and joins Imogen in the room below. Deanna uses Preserve Life to heal Fearne to consciousness.\n\nUpstairs, the fire is spreading and growing more intense as the party continues attacking and damaging the creature significantly. During the battle, Deanna panics at the amount of damage being inflicted on the party and casts Death Ward on Chetney. Unseen by the others, the Hatemonger Consumes Imogen, but eventually Fearne casts Burning Hands on the creature, getting the How do you want to do this? and freeing Imogen, still conscious.\n\nHowever, the fire is still growing. They remember the strange circle on the wall and FRIDA and FCG both cast spells on it, causing it to open and reveal a small cubby holding an old leather satchel which FCG nabs.  Chetney and FRIDA hang back, continuing to search the room and take fire damage as the others flee, but they find nothing further. When the body of the dead Hatemonger cracks open and a tendril emerges, they all run for the exit. FRIDA uses a flask of oil to set fire to the bottom room, while Imogen uses Telekinesis to lift the now-fully emerged creature and shove it back into the flaming room. When it continues to try to pursue them, FCG uses Stone Shape to close off the only exit.\n\nThe party attempts to stealth away while healing up a bit, but FRIDA and Imogen inadvertently create some loud noises. In the distance, they can hear howls approaching and they decide the safest course is to head north, directly out of the city but into the dark depths of the Savalirwood . They are narrowly able to climb over the city wall just ahead of the vicious, pursuing Wolf-King , and stumble through the night into the relative safety of the forest.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party heals up a bit more, while putting distance between themselves and the city. They find a sheltered spot to stop and rest. FCG opens the satchel found in Ludinus Da'leth 's tower but it is trapped, dealing the aeormaton substantial damage. After healing, they discover it is a Bag of Holding . They turn it upside down and shake it to discover a lot of seemingly blank paper, coins and gems, a small rod (which they later learn can act as a tuning fork for the Fey Realm when casting Plane Shift ), a staff, and a leather and brass harness with an attached funnel. FCG Identifies the staff as a Staff of Dark Odyssey , which among other things can cast Teleport . Chetney realizes the paper is not truly blank, and Deanna 's Detect Magic reveals faint magical traces on the harness and the rod, strong magic on the staff, and writing in Elvish on the paper, which she is able to read.\n\nThe first batch of notes revolves around experiments on divine magical essence and attempts to distill the nature of divinity into energy. They also contain the design of the arcane leather harness with notes discussing a regimen of magical infusion, synthetically recreating the natural magics \"that sustain the venerable Wardens of the Wilds\". There are notes on dryads and fey , and fey entities with locations throughout Wildemount , with maps indicating regions, eight of which are crossed off with notes about \"feeding the root\". The party gathers that at sometime in the past, the fey entities were used to power this harness, funneling their energy to the wearer. The final notes speak of expanding his \"restoration sources\" into the Fey Realm .\n\nThe second batch of notes discusses the red moon Ruidus and the temples' fear and avoidance of it. Ludinus reveals his wish that he had been Ruidusborn himself, and his plans to employ an \"enhanced communion ritual\" during a flare to try to learn more. Another note complains about the \"Emerald Cross priests\" (possibly clerics of the Arch Heart ) undermining his research. However, it appears he was indeed able to touch something alien that existed sealed away on the periphery of the magical Weave , but needed something stronger to break through.\n\nThe third batch has pages torn out, but notes the \"slowly expanding chaotic nature of the arcane crystals that form the power well beneath the city .\" It notes Aramond Tuestrel , the Grand-Conservator of the crystal well at the time of the city's destruction, believed the well was a gift from the gods, while \"Ezradan\" believed it was arcane in nature and had likely fallen from one of the ancient floating cities of the Age of Arcanum . Ludinus' notes discussed plans to harness this power source by secretly focusing it during an Apogee solstice to communicate with the entity he believed was seeking his attention from Ruidus.\n\nThe party discusses what to do with this information and where to go with their newly-gained potential ability to Teleport . FRIDA is reluctant to share the information with the Diarchy . Chetney suggests possibly going to Rexxentrum or Vasselheim ; FCG brings up the Woodset Auditors of the Vellum Steeple ; Imogen suggests the Cobalt Soul , or better,  rejoining the others from Bells Hells by returning to Jrusar . Unable to reach a decision, they decide to explore FRIDA's mind to try to discover any information they may possess without knowing it. Before starting, FRIDA presents FCG with one of a set of matching sweatshirts.\n\nImogen and FCG both cast Detect Thoughts on FRIDA and enter their mind. They see a hooded, metal-masked figure (which they recognize as D ) rousing the aeormaton from an extended stasis, and then FRIDA wandering through unfamiliar places and being met with fear before meeting Deanna. Although FRIDA tries to focus on the children, they experience memories of warfare. FCG and Imogen push deeper and see more of the battle, which seems to be taking place in stone hallways, surrounded by armored robed figures: the enemy is attacking FRIDA and FRIDA is killing in return. FRIDA realizes they are defending something against an enemy that looks and is dressed similarly to their own side. They are not fighting invaders, but an enemy from within. Looking behind to see what they are defending, they see a central massive cylindrical chamber holding an immense, complex, powerful machine surrounded by engineers and mages. A voice shouts in a foreign language, which FCG and FRIDA recognize as saying \"Protect the Factorum !\" As they watch, the crystals in the machinery light up as it readies itself, but there is a flash of white and the memories end with psychic damage to all three of them.\n\nChetney remembers they have heard of the Factorum Malleus , and that the Malleus Key was based on that technology. The Factorum Malleus was the weapon Aeor was using to try to take down the gods . FRIDA then remembers that when they were discovered by D, they were almost destroyed and had to be rebuilt, then were set free. The others realize the similarities between the third Malleus Key and the Factorum Malleus of FRIDA's memories, although the Key was on a much smaller scale. FCG recognized the language and the clothing of those in the memories, but has no memory of the Factorum Malleus itself. FRIDA sorrowfully realizes that they were fighting to protect the machine that was trying to kill the gods, and that in doing so, they killed a lot of people. Chetney sees this, and gives FRIDA a wooden figure of an aeormaton he made, to remind FRIDA of their protective instincts and qualities. Fearne adds that they had been acting under orders, but are now free to do what they want.\n\n![Imogen thumb wrestling - Dadrielle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b5/Imogen_thumb_wrestling_-_Dadrielle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/240?cb=20230516020047)\n\n![Passionate night by Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3a/Passionate_night_by_Melissa_Hahn.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230702172624)\n\nThey decide to try to Teleport to Jrusar in the morning. FRIDA believes this is now their fight as well, and wants to go with them-- and also doesn't want to leave FCG. They go off together to watch the moon. Deanna is not happy and says nothing while walking away. Chetney joins her, asking if she's all right. Deanna is afraid FRIDA is moving on, and maybe she should just go back to Uthodurn to tell them what they've learned while the others go on together. Chetney tries to comfort her that they really needed her healing, and asks about the Death Ward . Deanna admits she doesn't want anything bad to happen to him, and Chetney gives her a wooden carving of a shell in memory of their time together on the Menagerie Coast . He tells her she's needed and has a place with them. They hug, and Deanna asks if the werewolf thing is just for fighting. Thoughtfully, Chetney responds that there's only one way to find out, and Deanna begins \"calling for help\" from Fearne, who happily agrees to join them. Chetney transforms and the three run into the woods and disappear. Left alone, Imogen plays thumb wrestling with herself.\n\n![Avandra's vision by Cha Cha Rae](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe party rejoins in the morning. They agree they are all going together, and discuss again where to go. FCG realizes they can ask the Changebringer and casts Commune , asking if they'd have a chance to find their friends there if they went to Jrusar. The answer comes: Yes. They are alive. FCG's last question is if he will know FRIDA for a long time, but the goddess cannot answer since the future has not yet happened. Suddenly, the towering deity appears close to FCG, telling him: \"A terrible fate looms for all Exandria . An alien malice menaces the skies of the Marquesian sands. If you indeed wish to show your faith, to walk my endless paths beyond, then rise to our call. The winds of change blow cold against us all, yet hope remains unmoving in you. Our grace carries those who carry our banner. Hold it high and traverse the path I alight with purpose and fated destination. Do not turn from this road, for only shadow and solitude awaits behind. The Red End stirs in its slumber. Do not let it wake.\"\n\nSimultaneously, Deanna has a vision of the Dawnfather , who tells her: \"Mortal arrogance makes unions with the forbidden scourge. The ruddy moon beckons over the lands of Marquet. Child reborn of my grace and will, I command you, strike out against those that seek to snuff our light. These gifts I grant you are your sword and shield against the growing darkness. Forsake these gifts, ignore our charge, and be abandoned.\" Confused, Deanna asks how she can help, and is told faith needs unerring conviction, not logic or truth. He ends by also saying, \"The Red End stirs in its slumber. Do not let it wake.\"\n\nDeanna and FCG compare notes, and FCG notes you don't make demands unless you're insecure in your own life. It's coming from fear. He notices his Changebringer coin is now warm, and seems shinier, and casts Identify on it to learn it is now the Coin of the Changebringer with unrevealed new abilities. Although it is not true, he tells FRIDA the Changebringer promised they would be together for a long time. Meanwhile, Deanna give Chetney her Ring of Temporal Salvation , and Chetney requests he keep the Bag of Holding since in his previous employment in Rexxentrum he was required to carry one and has experience with them. In a previous job, he had to make a series of deadly chairs for the Cerberus Assembly that would be enchanted to kill everyone and then move to the center of the room. [1] Later, he was kicked out of his union, the Rexxentrum Toy Authority, and the rest of the group realizes that the initials and symbol tattooed on his shoulder stand for the union, not \"Respect the Alpha\" as he had insisted. Deanna backs Chetney that rebranding is possible and important.\n\nImogen takes the Staff, at least for now, and prepares to cast Teleport , choosing to aim for Zhudanna 's home where Imogen and Laudna formerly lived. She casts the spell, taking 14 points of damage from expending the Staff's charges. They all clasp hands and feel the spell's energy surrounding them as they are pulled into another space.\n\n### Post-game [ ]\n\nLaura rolled a d100 to determine the success or failure of the Teleport , with a 5% chance of a mishap, but only Matt and she were able to see the roll. She gasped and covered her mouth, and Matt cackled, ending the stream without revealing the result.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e58-escape_from_the_past"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E59-Somewhere Out There","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off with this half of Bells Hells , you with your troop of found family had plunged into the dangerous realm of the Hellcatch Valley in chase of Ludinus Da'leth and the Ruby Vanguard as they attempted to utilize the Apogee Solstice to some terrifying degree in locking onto the red moon of Ruidus , and in hopes of releasing the terrifying predator of the gods . You, along with your friends, managed to circumvent some of the scope of what you thought might transpire (hopefully), but your airship rained down, destroying a number of the Vanguard in its wake. A number of other ships began to arrive just as you watched as your leader, the Voice of the Tempest , was brought low by Otohan Thull , and before a death blow could be delivered, some dark guardian rushed in to protect her. This guardian, part of Ludinus' plan, was then drawn, compressed, and turned into a lens for his device, and the last thing you remember was all of the surrounding Ruidusborn granting their unintentional energy towards this climactic blast up to the red moon, and then a bright white light engulfed you all, and you awoke in a strange land, still at night beneath the starry sky, the shifting tethers of the Apogee Solstice leylines still visual and multicolored across multiple directions of the sky like an extended lattice or weave.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAshton , Laudna , and Orym find themselves in darkness halfway up a wall of a geothermally active gorge, with the rest of the party missing. They can still see, far off in the distance to the south, the red beam of energy tethering Ruidus in place over the Tishtan excavation site where Ludinus Da'leth enacted his Apogee Solstice ritual. Laudna recalls the geothermally active places she knows: the Truscan Vale in Wildemount , a location near the Panagrip Sands of Marquet , and the Spectrum Gorge of central Issylra . They worry about where the rest of the party is. Orym tries his two sending stones , first the one paired with Caleb Widogast 's, and then with Dorian Storm 's. Neither works.\n\nLaudna sends Pâté out scouting and they decide to head upward. Orym climbs up with Laudna's immovable rod and a rope and the others follow, being scalded by an erupting geyser along the way. Midway, Orym sees movement and encounters a dwarven woman who also has no idea where they are or how she got here. She is very cautious of the group, but helps pull up Ashton and Laudna to join them on the ledge. She tells them her name is \"Mona\" , and that she won't tell them her real name until she trusts them more. They compare notes, and learn that an hour ago she was in Tal'Dorei (although she can't remember specifically where) closing in on her ex-fiancé who had left her in the lurch, when suddenly she heard a male voice in her head as if he were giving a speech, there was a loud noise like a crack, and she found herself in the gorge. The party realizes she heard Ludinus at the climax of his ritual. \"Mona\" notices the colorful ribbons of the drifting leylines overhead were much denser where she was in Tal'Dorei than here.\n\nJoined by \"Mona\", they resume climbing upward and reach the top of the chasm. They find themself on its northeastern edge, with Ruidus hanging in the southern sky. The dwarf passes around a flask of strong liqueur before they start working their way around the edge of the gorge, trying to head roughly south. Orym climbs a tree and can see beyond the edge of the dense forest to a grassy hill land. He notices a leyline nexus far to the northeast, with lights and an apparent town in that distant valley. Beyond that, to the north, is a massive mountain range , and north of that rises an immensely tall mountain . To the west and southwest is another very tall and dangerous-looking mountain range , and directly to the south, beyond the grasslands, the faint glitter of ocean water.\n\nThey decide to head northeast toward the lights Orym saw, following (for now) a river that flows into the gorge and leads directly east, and moving stealthily. Eventually, they notice a small fire in the forest and Pâté scouts it, finding a small cart drawn by a reindeer-type creature and a humanoid figure near the fire. Orym and \"Mona\" approach, startling the figure who immediately fires a crossbow at them, but misses, and starts running away. Orym calls after him, assuring him they mean him no harm, and approaches hands up. The figure is a very tall, very thin half-elf, dressed like a farmer, who is spooked when the still-hidden \"Mona\" calls out and reflexively hits her with a Lightning Bolt . Laudna approaches, ready to cast Eldritch Blast , but Orym tries to calm the rapidly escalating situation by dropping his weapons and sitting down. Laudna aims her blast to just miss the half-elf, and they all agree to a truce. The half-elf introduces himself: Bor'Dor Dog'Son , a sheep herder. He casts Cure Wounds on \"Mona\" in apology, but she pickpockets a sling from him as he does.\n\nBor'Dor's story is similar to the others'. He was on \"the mountain\", and then he was here. Pressed for more information, he was in the Cyrios Mountains near Pride's Call , tending his sheep and caring for his sick brother when he heard a humming and a voice in his head and he ended up here. His ability to throw lightning is brand new, since he arrived a couple of hours ago. Things have just been happening to him.\n\n![Prism - Toby James Sharp](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/8f/Prism_-_Toby_James_Sharp.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20230524005106)\n\nAshton pulls out the portable hole , looking for food, but realizes they forgot to dispose of the bodies they'd stashed in it. When he throws them out, Orym tries to reassure the two newcomers that the corpses were bad people who were trying to kill them. Bor'Dor volunteers his reindeer, Ratchet, to help with the bodies. As they work, Orym hears cracking branches and sees a figure approaching cautiously. When he calls out a welcome, the figure steps out, revealing a goth-looking elf with pointy teeth and ears, dressed like a mage's apprentice and arguing with her book. She asks if they have time to participate in a short survey about their experience with the Apogee Solstice , explaining that she's been sent out to gather data for the Cobalt Soul , \"the premiere academic institution in Exandria \". As she speaks, her book Dynios pipes up reminding her to remember her place and their argument resumes. \"Mona\" overhears and misunderstands, asking why she's calling her by her real name, which she reveals is actually Deni$e .\n\nThe Cobalt Soul elf explains that she was sent out with a sentient book chaperone, and Dynios introduces himself. She was given a list of questions to ask those she met, and was told since she gets sick when she teleports, they would just let her get shunted, and she appeared here. Dynios adds that the intent was they arrive at a city near one of the nexuses and neither of them know how they ended up in their current location. Prism heard a voice but she was surrounded by people and didn't really notice.\n\nThey all introduce themselves again. Prism is taken aback that Bor'Dor can just suddenly do magic, when she has had to work and study for all of hers. She admits her magic has never been field-tested. She's similarly envious when Laudna admits she was born with her magic, but she begins asking her questions. They are interrupted by more rustling in the bushes. Prism hopes it's more people for more data points for her survey, but the sounds grow more ominous, like dozens of large ropes dragging through the underbrush. They prepare for battle, Laudna assuming her Form of Dread to the horror of their new friends. Bor'Dor shrieks and vomits as large plant-like tendrils emerge from the floor of the forest and rush toward them.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![The battle - Ziforyu](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/62/The_battle_-_Ziforyu.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230601194330)\n\nPreparing for battle, Deni$e and Orym climb a tree; Laudna assumes her Form of Dread and Spider Climbs into another tree; Ashton takes cover; Prism casts Greater Invisibility on herself and manifests the mind of Dynios , sending her raven Mother with him; and Bor'Dor spends his turn screaming and vomiting. Two sections of the forest floor seem to come alive and reach out, and the party attacks. The shambling mounds are fairly easy to hit and the party is damaging them, when Ashton steps backward into a bush and disturbs another creature, a corpse flower , and the plants are able to hit the party hard in return, as well as the corpse flower emitting a stench that poisons party members starting their turn within 10 feet unless they succeed on a Constitution save. Prism, invisible, uses Dynios to cast Steel Wind Strike and hits all three plants, two critically, killing one and seriously wounding the others. Bor'Dor is absolutely terrified but hits with a Ray of Frost .\n\nAs the battle continues, Orym takes more damage, is grappled by the remaining mound, and engulfed by it. Prism immediately sends Dynios through the creature, casting Dimension Door to transport Orym to safety. Bor'Dor succumbs to the corpse flower poison but gets off a Lightning Bolt , learning that the mound is immune to lightning. Orym take a Second Wind, then attacks the mound, killing it, Laudna hits the corpse flower with a Chill Touch that prevents it regaining hit points, and Deni$e gets the final blow against it with her whip .\n\nPeace restored, Bor'Dor apologizes for losing his cool, and Prism admits this was also her first time ever in combat and she found it thrilling. Ratchet the reindeer has fled, but Bor'Dor is sure he'll come back. They decide to use the corpses from the portable hole set up around the remains of the campfire as a decoy while they sleep elsewhere, with Magic Mouth on the corpses to shout if anything comes near. The party sets up camp for the night. Bells Hells fill in the others about Ludinus Da'leth , Predathos , and their plans for the Apogee Solstice , and talk about their current goals: find out where they are, find their friends, and survive. Bor'dor just wants to get back to Pride's Call .\n\n![Bor'Dor and Prism on watch - Jake Wennik](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f7/Bor%27Dor_and_Prism_on_watch_-_Jake_Wennik.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230522134610)\n\nThey settle down for the night, with Prism and Bor'Dor taking first watch. He asks her about her earlier statement when hearing about Lucinus' plans that the world might be better off without the gods . She explains that the main deity in the Shadow Realm is the Matron of Ravens , who ascended to godhood on her own. She's excited to be out of the library, but is hanging on by a thread. They share cigarettes and sympathize with each others' fears.\n\nLaudna and Ashton take the next watch. Laudna is just barely holding it together over her fears for Imogen and the others. Ashton is feeling guilty and depressed over failing to stop Ludinus, and promises Laudna they'll get the others back. Comforted, Laudna sends Pâté out to look for the missing reindeer.\n\nOrym and Deni$e take the final watch, and she asks him about himself. They're both from Tal'Dorei , and in the conversation about her search for her ratfink ex, she reveals his name is Dariax . Orym recognizes the name from their time together with the Crown Keepers , and Deni$e asks if he's the little guy she kept seeing on the \"Wanted\" posters. This is news to Orym. He asks her what went wrong in her relationship with Dariax. They were stealing furs while \"pre-engaged\" and he just disappeared, and a lot of people are now coming after her for the missing money. Just when she finally caught up to him, she found herself in Issylra. Orym tells her he's a good guy, and she admits Dariax has a good heart and she's a hopeless romantic. Orym is having flashbacks of the horrors of the previous day, and she notices, asking about his friends and if he left someone behind. He tells her he knows he's supposed to say they'll find their missing friends and figure it out, but he's having trouble believing it, and she responds that while it would be nice to believe in a god right now, as a substitute, she's got booze. Orym takes it and drinks, and admits he's never felt so small.\n\n![Orym surveying the Demithore Valley - @MiddiMidori](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nIn the morning, Orym climbs the hill and finds a tree to climb, looking out around them. He now recognizes the Ascendant Bridge Mountain and the Sunderpeak Mountains that separate this area, the Demithore Valley , from Othanzia and its capital, Vasselheim . Ruidus is visible far to the south, still locked in place beyond the ocean. Nearby, however, there are roads through the forest and small villages and townships scattered throughout the valley.\n\nPâté returns without having found the reindeer, but Bor'Dor assures them it's okay. Prism offers to cast Phantom Steed for him, but he tells her not to; the reindeer will probably be in town. They agree to head toward the nearest town, a village visible just below the nexus point still visible in the sky a number of miles off.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e59-somewhere_out_there"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E57-The Sorrow of Molaesmyr","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, half of Bells Hells , with their new travel companions from Uthodurn , F.R.I.D.A. and Deanna , have helped save some of the populace of Uthodurn in the midst of the post- Applebee's SoulCycle dangers. In doing so, they gained some favor from the Diarchy of Uthodurn , and in doing so, also discovered a little bit about the history of Ludinus Da'leth , the antagonistic figure of the minute, hour, millennium, who seemingly for a while, hailed from the elven town of Molaesmyr that was destroyed three centuries before and is not too far off from the city of Uthodurn, to the southwest, in the middle of the now-corrupted Savalirwood that itself was corrupted by the incident that destroyed the city of Molaesmyr.\n\nSo, gathering supplies, you all trekked in that direction. You got goats that you rode across the mountains, killed one of them to feed to the others, left them behind on the banks of the lake . You built a raft, floated down the Boreal Omen River , until you eventually came to the outskirts of the ruins of Molaesmyr. Here, in this heavily altered, overgrown and deeply dangerous haunted locale, you've managed to notice a few of the strange changed beasts that wander the surrounding region, and began to stealth your way carefully between the somewhat damaged and frozen-in-time, unoccupied (you hope) structures across the cityscape.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nWith Pass Without Trace and Telepathic Bond up, the party stealthily heads in what they assume is the direction of Gildhollow Tower, the former home of Ludinus Da'leth within Molaesmyr , trying to avoid the noise-sensitive mutated elk. They proceed through the strange ruined city and its purplish-grey foliage, avoiding occasional miasma-producing fissures and skeletal bodies, toward a very tall central tower from which the damage seems to have originated. They notice tiny motes or spores floating in the air, numerous ghosts appearing and disappearing, and twisted, horrific trees. When FRIDA casts Decompose on one of the skeletons, it seems to shift slightly before turning to ash and Imogen suggests magic may draw the ghosts' attention.\n\nThey move on, hearing a faint howl from the distance, and reach the point where they need to choose to go either to the north or south side of the central tower. FCG casts Divination and asks the Changebringer which is the safest route, and the breeze clears the mist from the rightward path. The ghosts of the fallen citizens of the city, as well as the miasma-producing fissures, become more numerous as they approach the center city. FCG casts Spirit Guardians in the form of tiny floating FRIDAs, but it draws the attention of the spirits surrounding them. Deanna uses Turn Undead to drive off all but five who attack the party.\n\n![Possessed Chetney by Edu Benavente](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f8/Possessed_Chetney_by_Edu_Benavente.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230511225354)\n\n![Flying creature by Clara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d2/Flying_creature_by_Clara.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230506152135)\n\nDuring the battle, FCG conjures his Spiritual Weapon in the form of himself. Chetney fails a Charisma save and becomes possessed by the spirit of a teenaged girl, and on his turn attacks FCG. Deanna casts Greater Restoration on him, restoring him to his right mind. Meanwhile, the other spirits are being damaged by the party's attacks and are gradually destroyed, with Chetney getting the final blow against the last of them. The remaining spectres in the vicinity scatter, but the party notices a large wing-like limb move in the top of the nearby central tower . They hide as a large creature like a headless multi-legged pterosaur flies over and disappears.\n\nMoving into a nearby building to investigate, they find it has been looted but still holds a tapestry bearing the symbol of a white tree, the insignia of the city of Molaesmyr. Moving upward, they find a warped tree with screaming faces in its trunk growing from the center of the ruined second story. Its branches reach for them as they push past. From the vantage point of the topmost floor, they can see at the edge of the city to the northwest, about a half mile away, a blue, silvered leaning tower which they guess is Ludinus's Gildhollow Tower. FRIDA offers to remain as a lookout while the rest of the party heads in that direction.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Wolf-King by Sam Rusk](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3c/Wolf-King_by_Sam_Rusk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230508231449)\n\nAs the party, less FRIDA , moves northwest, FCG 's wheel falls into a fissure, releasing miasma and reducing his maximum hit points. Chetney asks how he's feeling and FCG admits his stress level is high. FRIDA warns them of the flying creature's return and they hide. When the coast is clear, FRIDA heads toward the others but a bridge noisily collapses beneath the aeormaton , and the entire group hears multiple howls approaching from a few streets away. FRIDA begins sprinting as Chetney transforms his lower half into his wolf form, but FRIDA runs at an angle to the party so as not to lead these creatures to them. Imogen casts a noisy Seething Storm at a distance which distracts the pursuing growls, and FRIDA can now change course toward the party. However, the growling creatures are now aimed directly at the pursuing FCG and Chetney. Chetney pulls FCG behind a boulder and FCG uses Stone Shape to disguise them further, and the wolves pass them harmlessly. Fearne and Deanna hide behind an illusory wall Deanna creates and Imogen hides in the bushes. They see five massive, thirty-foot-long direwolf creatures with elongated torsos and necks joining into a singular back half: the Wolf-King . It runs past without seeing them.\n\n![The Wolf-King and the Guardian of Faith by Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen decides to try once more casting Sending even though it's failed in the past, and for the first time since arriving on Wildemount , the message gets through and Imogen is able to tell FCG that FRIDA is safe at the tower. The party now rejoined, they hear the Wolf-King approaching, attracted by the movement and noise. They climb up the vegetation covering the Gildhollow Tower, out of reach of the pursuing creature, and climb in a window, Deanna leaving a Guardian of Faith in the form of Wolf Chetney behind. FCG becomes jealous when Imogen touches FRIDA's butt while helping them ascend the wall. As the creature pursues them and begins to climb after them, it takes radiant damage from the Guardian and eventually falls back to the ground, prowling for a few minutes before slinking off.\n\nThe party finds themselves in a debris-filled central chamber of the tower, with the tilt of the tower making the floors lean slightly. The room has been heavily looted, contains the remains of a camp, and several bodies of varying vintages. Thin, paper-like material stretches across the walls and corners. Fearne determines from the color scheme and elven decorations that Ludinus Da'leth could indeed at one time have lived here. They head upstairs, Chetney locating a trap on the way which Deanna uses Dispel Magic to disarm. They reach the room beyond, where they find notes about patterns of arcana in various times and cultures, notations about recurring patterns of shifts in magic and celestial effects, and the names of specialists to reach out to or historical figures with potential knowledge: Vaatora, Laerryn , and Vishtaraan. There is also what appears to be notes written on pages torn from a religious tome for a speech pointing out that this is temple propaganda and that there is no real truth or plan in what the gods present, and notes indicating a fascination with finding the true name of the Matron of Ravens before her ascension.\n\nChetney notices amid the dust on the skin-covered wall an odd circular space where the dust clings, and determines the wall behind the spot is real and not illusory. When Deanna casts Light on her staff and touches the circle, however, it seems to absorb the magical energy, extinguishing it but glowing faintly for a moment. They hypothesize the circle needs magic. FRIDA finds something oddly familiar about this, but is unable to determine anything further or recover the memory. Imogen suggests that she and FCG could help FRIDA recover the memory in the way that they aided Ashton weeks earlier. FRIDA agrees, although unsure this is a good time for it.\n\nMeanwhile, still in wolf-form, Chetney continues investigating the room, eventually climbing up to a cluster of roots on the ceiling and pulling them apart. His hand touches something soft and he catches the smell of rotting citrus and carrion, and when he pulls his hand back, there is crimson dripping down his fingers. They all suddenly hear heavy impacts as the roots and branches above them shift and are parted, and something heavy and pinkish-red emerges from the hole it has created, covered in bestial, stretching faces. It slams onto the stone floor in the center of the chamber, and begins to take shape, drawing inspiration from the party and from the other creatures it has seen within the city.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e57-the_sorrow_of_molaesmyr"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E55-Hope Within History","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Half of Bells Hells had encountered two new allies, some with ancient histories, and some with more ancient histories. Upon searching for a means of reaching out to the other half of your unknown troop, magic is changing. Ancient enchantments seem to have been undone and a bit of disarray is beginning to unravel, even here in the town of Uthodurn in the Flotket Alps . Upon searching around for answers, you happened to save a lot of members of the town from one such enchantment that held a petrified forest spirit from the Veluthil Forest and upon doing so, were granted an audience to come with the king and queen of the Diarchy here in Uthodurn.\n\nIn the interim time, you rested for the evening here at Deanna 's house, enjoyed a fine breakfast, and went to drop by D&O's Toy Emporium where you found yourself radically and rapidly hired to deal with other such bits of chaos that seemed to have gotten free within the toy store. You battled some of these firebugs within, and the strangely mutated, terrifying mascot of the toy emporium, which had now become a terrifying arachnid-type creature . You did battle with it in the upper region of the toy store, turned it back into its baby form for about an hour, quickly ran out into the snow and left it to be dealt with by the Glassblades as you rushed back in. Since then, you reconvened and had a bit of a somewhat conversation of closure with Oltgar , of which you had previously seen when you stabbed him in the hand and fled from Uthodurn many years ago, sending him on his way to bring the joy of his toys to children around Exandria .\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nSince it's now midday, the party travels to the Grandcast Citadel, on the way speculating on the nature of the relationship between the king and queen , the status of the possibly-released-by-magic's-weakening-but-now-armless Planerider Ryn , and what they actually want to gain from this audience. When they reach the Citadel, they notice repairs are almost complete. Fearne approaches a very well-dressed older male dwarf , Desavon Kamash , who is leaving the throne room and while doing some mild flirting, manages to pickpocket a ring woven into his beard.\n\n![The meeting with the Diarchy - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/17/The_meeting_with_the_Diarchy_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20230420222337)\n\nThe king and queen greet them warmly and give them the titles of \"Protectors of the Diarchy\" plus a monetary reward, and offer to grant reasonable requests. Chetney presents them with a wooden bull he carved, and the king explains that Umudara had been a spirit that watched over the citizens when they still lived in the Veluthil Forest , before the corruption began. The Queen tells them that along with the other magical disruptions, resurrection magics are not working due to the Apogee Solstice , and they have sent magical practitioners to other cities to investigate. Those mages seem to have teleported successfully and are due back within a week or so, at which time they could hopefully transport the party where they wish to go. FRIDA tells the rulers about Drixlitch 's illicit activities and they promise to deal with him.\n\nThe party also shares that they saw the events on Marquet that probably contributed to the issues with magic, and tells them that Ludinus Da'leth was involved. Imathan shares a bit of the history of the corruption of the city of Molaesmyr , which he and Ludinus both survived, and which took place during a previous Apogee Solstice . The rulers also confirm that this solstice seems to be continuous: whereas it should have ended a day or two ago, the effects on the ley lines are continuing and show no signs of lessening, and Ruidus has disappeared. The party proposes to the rulers that they travel to the ruins of Molaesmyr to see if they can learn more there, and the king offers travel advice and gives them a map. It will take a little over a week each direction. The rulers also give them a set of mithral half plate armor and a gift certificate to a clothing shop.\n\nOn their way up to the Vellum Steeple , FRIDA checks in with Deanna and shares during their conversation that they think they have a crush on Fresh Cut Grass . For the first time, they feel understood. Deanna reassures them she thinks it's wonderful and wants nothing but happiness for FRIDA. FRIDA and FCG decide to split from the rest of the group and visit Jaquoby Macyl , while the rest proceed to the Steeple.\n\nAt the Steeple, they meet with Ressia Uvesic who gives them a dossier on Ludinus Da'leth. The party also requests information about the Savalirwood and Molaesmyr, and Ressia refers them to Keenash Serevoldin , Chief Auditor of the Woodset Auditors . When Keenash warns them it is dangerous, Deanna shares that she and FRIDA have just returned from the even-more-dangerous Eiselcross , and survived. He tells them the creatures shift and mutate, the shadows speak into your mind, and there are many ghosts. The corruption seems to emanate from deep beneath the city where some of the final research had been in progress. The group reads the dossier on Ludinus while traveling onward to the clothing shop, learning he came to Wildemount from the elven town of Ivaadel in Issylra when young, and rose to prominence in the Dwendalian Empire when he helped stop the violence of the Eve of Crimson Midnight .\n\n![Aeormatons kissing - Sabira Langevin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/07/Aeormatons_kissing_-_Sabira_Langevin.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230417204633)\n\nMeanwhile, FRIDA and FCG go to the workshop of Jaquoby Macyl, a tinkerer who has worked on FRIDA. Before they go in, FCG thanks FRIDA for their help, and both of them share how wonderful it is to meet someone like themselves. FCG asks FRIDA if Deanna is special to them, and FRIDA responds they love her very much, but when FCG seems a bit disappointed, FRIDA hurries to reassure him that while she's a person in their life, she's not their person. FRIDA then asks if FCG has a person, and is told that there used to be someone , but he tried to kill her. FRIDA asks him if FRIDA were FCG's special person, would he try to kill them, and FCG assures them not. FRIDA kisses him, before knocking on the door.\n\nThey are exuberantly greeted by Jaquoby in his cluttered shop, where FCG gives him the mithral armor, asking if the metal can be integrated into an armor upgrade to his chassis. While inspecting him to figure out ways to possibly add legs or other means of locomotion, Jaquoby removes his faceplate, reading the name inscribed within: \"Faithful Care-Giver\".\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nAs they walk toward the clothing shop, Chetney asks Imogen how she's feeling about the encounter with her mother at the Malleus Key . Imogen shares that it's been difficult, since in the past her mother's voice in her dreams was so comforting in urging her away from the storm, and in the confrontation with Ludinus Da'leth , she was fighting for it. Imogen is grappling with the reality that when push came to shove, Lilliana helped make it all happen. Imogen also wonders what happened to her mother: whether she is one of the reilora she saw in her dream, or was sent away as the party was, or is just gone.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Jaquoby's , FRIDA is admiring FCG 's upgraded armor. They ask Jaquoby about using their power core as a battery for other enchantments, and is told it might be possible. Jaquoby gives them some cables for experimentation, and a package of various scrap metal for snacks.\n\nOn the way upward, Deanna quietly slips into a temple to the Dawnfather and finds Evodon Leeds , one of the priests she knows. He tells her it seems that, while the gods are still there, they have turned away, which makes him feel alone and abandoned. But he is now convinced the temple should remain open, and Deanna gives him 500 gold, promising to help more when she returns. As she leaves, he invites the people outside in.\n\n![New clothes - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6b/New_clothes_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20230419141109)\n\nEventually, everyone gathers at Catlyn's Clothier where they show her the note from the king and queen giving them full credit there. After initial suspicion, she greets them warmly. Chetney orders a velvety, strechable hooded track suit; Imogen gets a floor-length long-sleeved flowy dress with a leather body piece underneath and a cropped leather hooded overcoat; FCG gets a long leather duster jacket like FRIDA's in blue rather than green; Deanna gets a stretch green bodysuit; FRIDA has their ripped coat repaired and FCG's name added inside it; Fearne asks for the finest top drawer fabrics to be made up for her, but legless, since hers are furry. The women also decide to get matching corsets, including one for the missing Laudna. Chetney asks Deanna to knit him sweatbands and Fearne requests a knit wrap. The clothing is ready shortly.\n\nThe others ask FRIDA and FCG how their date went. FCG seems a little embarassed, but FRIDA holds his hand and he admits, \"Yeah, this is happening.\" Chetney asks what Deanna and FRIDA were doing in Eiselcross . They were seeking a connection with FRIDA's dreams but it was crawling with soldiers and monsters, so they left, hoping to come back when they were better prepared. Chetney asks if they're sure they want to come with them to Molaesmyr , and they are, but they point out that without resurrection magic, if they need to run, they should.\n\n![FCG posing for FRIDA - Jenny Dolfen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThey sleep at Deanna's house, but before bed Fearne makes an excuse and ducks out to visit the shrine of the Wildmother . There, she addresses a statue of the Wildmother: \"Hey, bitch.\" She confesses she doesn't know how to do this and Melora may be dead or non-existent, but if she's there, please watch over Orym and let him know they're okay. There is no response, but Fearne apologizes for calling her a bitch. When she gets back to Deanna's, she wakes Chetney and tells him, \"If you don't make a move on that woman, I'm going to.\" She goes upstairs and admits to the other women that she went to the Wildmother's temple, and they all have a discussion about the nature of happiness mixed with sadness, and speculating what FCG and FRIDA might be up to in the adjacent room behind the very thin wall. However, they are simply talking, and FRIDA draws FCG. They decide to power off together holding hands after telling each other, \"I like you.\"\n\nIn the morning, FCG Identifies the gloves Chetney found the previous day as Weavepiercer Gloves , and Imogen takes them. They head first to the small temple of the Matron of Ravens , where Chetney asks the priests if they can feel the Matron. They respond that she remains, though her thoughts are distant. The party then heads upward to buy and name six flot goats , using the letter of credit from the king and queen, before loading up and setting off into a clear, cold morning in the Flotket Alps .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e55-hope_within_history"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E82-Rush for the Bloody Bridge","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after a brief excursion into the Fey Realm to do some team building exercises after a bit of a fracture happened between their respective friendships before going into a recon mission to the Red Moon of Ill Omen . You acquired some materials. With the help of Allura Vysoren you returned to the Hellcatch Valley to one of the nearby resistance garrisons against the Ruby Vanguard 's plot under Ludinus Da'leth to unleash the god-eater Predathos that sits within that moon. Here, you've met with a number of powerful figures, this side of this troop. You were given an opportunity and a heavy distraction to sneak in from the southeastern side of the excavation site , and after being dropped off by Keyleth of the Air Ashari , her summoning a massive storm to give even more challenging power to the distraction that surrounds this site, you all begin to slink in under cover of magical shadow and disguises to appear like members of the Vanguard.\n\nYou pushed through the dense sandstorm, the sounds of conflict, explosions, shouts, and bestial war cries echoing from the other side of the massive pit. You approach the outskirts, and here you can see, just from where you stand, the shapes of where the cliff begins to reveal the edge of the excavation site. You see massive ballista now embedded into the side of that weren't there previously, a number of tents set up for individuals that are keeping watch (though you do not see immediately any signs of other figures other than the large, slowly lumbering Vanguard Warder that is peeking around while the majority of the defenses are shifting focus onto the other side of the site.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nFrom Bells Hells ' current position on the edge of the excavation pit in the middle of a Keyleth -created dust storm, they can see a patrolling Warder automaton , as well as several ballistas and soldiers, and a Reilora guarding a large arcane defensive device. Through the Telepathic Bond cast by FCG , they discuss possible plans. Chetney casts Invisibility on himself and stealths to the larger of the tents where he sees one nervous Ruby Vanguard trooper, then to a smaller, empty tent. He telepathically summons the others, and they stealthily move through the sandstorm to the inside of the larger tent. The soldier there assumes they are fellow soldiers come to fetch him and leaves to join the fray.\n\nFCG gives Chetney one of the two Percy -built arcane disruption devices, [1] and Chetney sneaks to the patrolling Warder , wedging the device into the automaton with some of FCG's sourdough starter. It detonates one minute later, downing the Warder. One of the patrolling soldiers notices and investigates but while he's distracted the others sneak past and onto the cliff. Laudna summons an invisible Pâté near the Reilora to make a minor distraction, but the familiar is quickly crushed by an immense Reiloran Juggernaut which emerges from another tent.\n\nThe group discusses possible ways to reach the bottom of the pit. Eventually Chetney casts Blood Curse of Binding on the juggernaut, then attacks it, while Imogen casts Fly on herself and in full sight of the Juggernaut, faux-commands Chetney to \"Stop!\" before casting Telekinesis on the gnome to pull him toward her and pretend to snap his neck. Thinking the situation has been dealt with, the juggernaut moves away. The other reilora isn't quite convinced but Imogen summons the others (wearing Ruby Vanguard clothing) and commands them to spread out to look for other infiltrators. Laudna's attempt to appear to be a Vanguard soldier is unconvincing, however, and the Reiloran telepathically attacks her. Orym immediately uses Seedling 's Grasping Vines to pull the Reiloran away from the strange arcane device near him while Ashton shoves him over the edge of the pit. Imogen then telekinetically topples the device over on top of the Reiloran, killing him. Bells Hells begins traveling down the switchbacking trail into the excavation pit, pretending to be soldiers.\n\nThere are at least two Warders below, but no sign of Otohan Thull 's presence when Laudna checks the scryball attuned to the ring planted on her. Around them, a battle is raging. They pass a few groups of Vanguard soldiers but are either able to pass, or to stay out of sight. Halfway down, they overhear a conversation in Marquesian coming from a small cave, discussing if it's more important to stay, or to be seen helping. The other replies: \"No, our job is important, we have to stay. Besides, don't leave me alone with them.\" Imogen realizes the Reilorans are making them uncomfortable. Chetney then uses the Monocle of True Essence to cast Arcane Eye and discover they (plus two Reilorans ) are guarding an unconscious shackled prisoner.\n\n![Chetney vs the shrikes](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/cc/Chetney_vs_the_shrikes.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/280?cb=20240115211649)\n\nChetney and Imogen enter the cave casually, telling the soldiers it's time for a shift change. Although the soldiers leave, the Reilorans tell Imogen telepathically they don't recognize her and were told by Otohan Thull herself to guard this prisoner. Chetney transforms into a werewolf and grapples one, but the other throws his chained blade at Imogen, hauling her in for close-in blade attacks and wounding her significantly. Fearne, however, is able to successfully cast Charm Person on both. Imogen uses her existing Telekinesis to slam one of Reiloran Shrikes into first the ceiling and then into the other Shrike. As she uses this power, the purple veins on her body glow and the Reiloran's eyes go wide. She follows up with a Lightning Bolt on both. Ashton rages and attacks with his hammer, killing one and seriously wounding the other, and Laudna kills the other with Eldritch Blast .\n\nAs a small group of soldiers approaches the outside of the cave, most of Bells Hells hide and Imogen props up one of the dead Reilora, but the soldiers pass on by. The party checks on the prisoner, who is injured and unconscious, so FCG casts Cure Wounds on him to bring him back. They question him quickly, and he explains he is Ishto , a holy warrior of the Lawbearer from the Glistening Spire in Yios in Aeshanadoor who was part of a scouting party of coalition forces that was wiped out, except for him. He warns them of hidden, movable sigils that turn people to stone, and agrees to join them in their scouting mission.\n\nAs the group heads out to resume their journey to the base of the pit and the foot of the Bloody Bridge , Chetney uses the Monocle of True Essence to cast See Invisibility . Once there, they notice the ruins have been destroyed to create a military base at the foot of the activated Malleus Key , dominated by the crimson glow of the Bloody Bridge itself.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThrough the dust storm, they can see the base of the Malleus Key now has stronger defenses than when they were previously there, and additional patrolling Warders . FCG heals Imogen slightly while Orym spots where Planerider Ryn 's petrified body was last, a few hundred feet away. Imogen casts Summon Crimson Shade to summon a Reilora to help them blend in better, causing a red mist to rise from both herself and Fearne , and the purple veins on her body begin to glow. With See Invisibility active, Chetney takes the lead but fails to notice a glyph, triggering it. He succeeds on his Constitution saving throw, however, and avoids being turned to stone, but he gives the Bag of Holding holding the Scroll of Greater Restoration to Fearne to hold. [Matt clarifies they were given components sufficient to cast the spell 5 times before leaving the encampment.] Ishto reiterates that he is willing to do and give anything, including his life, if it will help to protect the world, and is willing to go with them to the moon, although he is somewhat taken aback at the possibility.\n\nAs they move onward, Chetney is able to spot and point out four additional glyphs. He is unable to figure out the indicator or protection that helps the soldiers and reilora avoid the traps, however. Orym determines that Ryn's stone body has apparently been moved from its prior location, and sees that a larger stair structure has been added to the base of the Malleus Key tower, guarded by two warders , two ballistas, and a tripod assault ruin-crawler . There are also multiple reiloran and Ruby Vanguard soldiers and guards. Imogen asks her summoned reiloran if they are friends or foes to her, and is told that the Vanguard is aligned with the Imperium.\n\nAs the party strategizes, the energy beam flutters and four figures appear at its base: a Reiloran Thought Eater who rises high into the air and begins keeping watch, a tall, thin, elven Ruby Vanguard person of elevated rank, a soldier, and Otohan Thull . She calls to the soldiers to regroup at the Key before leaping 80 feet three times and vanishing into the storm. Laudna confirms her scryball is glowing at Otohan's presence.\n\nIn wolf form, Chetney sneaks to one of the arcane machines and determines it could possibly be altered to shoot directionally. FCG discovers he has two bombs in his inventory which he gives to Imogen, and they decide to use them to draw the attention of the guards while they dash for the stairway. Moving stealthily forward, Orym in the lead sets off a glyph and begins turning to stone, but FCG casts Greater Restoration on him. Imogen Twin Spells Catapult on the bombs and sends them 90 feet away as a distraction, while Laudna and Fearne chip in with fire spells. The Warders and guards begin heading toward the explosion while the party runs toward the Key. However, the floating Thought Eater notices their movement. The party aims several spells at him but he is able to telepathically alert all the guards in the area to their presence before Psychic Slamming both Orym and Ishto from a rooftop to the ground and reducing Ishto to 1 hit point.\n\n![The race for the bridge - Suraelis](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/78/The_race_for_the_bridge_-_Suraelis.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20240115210159)\n\nThe party continues to try to reach the tower while aiming attacks at the Thought Eater , doing some damage, but several Warders, crawlers , and Reiloran Juggernauts start moving in, with one perching at the tower's top. Fearne Polymorphs one of the Juggernauts into a possum and reaches the Bloody Bridge first, joined soon after by several others. FCG enters the red beam of light first at the urging of the others, vanishing up the Bloody Bridge. Ishto regains his feet and Divine Smites a soldier, then runs away from the Bridge, trying to distract the others. Laudna Spider Climbs up the tower and enters into the beam, followed by Ashton, who grabs Orym and Fearne with them as they do the same. The polymorphed and angry possum chases Fearne into the bridge.\n\n![Chetney vs](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f7/Chetney_vs._the_lightning_machine_-_PremArtwork.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20240126182858)\n\nThat leaves Imogen and Chetney. One of the Warders pushes a ruined building over, onto the lightning device Chetney has been firing, injuring him and knocking him prone. Imogen runs over and reads the Scroll of Dimension Door Allura gave them, transporting them both into the bridge. The beam is blinding red light, pulling them rapidly upward and in moments, they each find themselves standing on the receiving point of the Malleus Key, surrounded by red shale and dusty storms. Consuming a quarter of the sky, the globe of Exandria hangs above them.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e82-rush_for_the_bloody_bridge"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E86-Doorways to Darker Depths","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after arriving on the red moon Ruidus , trekked into one of the villages on the outside of the central capital city of Kreviris , encountered some of the locals , made some friends , ran into some enemies, took some out, took some captive . Then in the process of looking for a means of continued travel towards the city of your destination, some of you ran into Otohan Thull , who has been seemingly progressively on the trail of you since your arrival. Through a brief bit of a chaotic scuffle and escape, you all whisked yourselves away into the sky, and facing an oncoming storm, sought shelter a little ways northward, or north-esque on this small astral body.\n\nUpon diving into a nearby chasm, delving into its depths and finding some odd water network caverns and continuing to follow this strange source of water, you trekked through these winding tunnels, found a high splashing waterfall, climbed to the top, and found ancient ruins emerging from inside this rock-clustered cavern, seemingly from times long forgotten. As you trekked through these ruins and began to look for a way of getting back to the surface or finding a safe to rest at the very least, you found some unique elements lost to time forever, locked in this moment before cataclysm, and then found the source of this burbling river of water that was carving from the rock. Out of curiosity, Fearne transformed into a sheep-leaved sea slug. Upon pushing through the forceful water, you eventually found yourself in a less cramped space, in less constantly pressured, coursing water. Clambering upward toward a light source, you breached into an unfamiliar lake beneath a blue and cloud-dappled sky, beautiful cold air surrounding forests and mountain tops with white snow dusting across their peaks.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nFearne finds herself swimming in a lake surrounded by trees and mountains. She determines the portal is still there and immediately dives through it and returns to the rest of the party, telling them what she saw. There is much discussion of whether they should take a long rest before or after going through the portal (some of the party are very low on spells, but if they go now they still have Keyleth 's Wind Walk spell to aid in exploring). Eventually they decide to go now, but first, using their new shared Ruidusborn ability, Fearne gives Imogen four sorcery points. Using a rope and the immovable rod , the party moves through the tunnel and into the lake.\n\nAbove them, Catha is visible in the sky, although Ruidus and Exandria are not. The shifting ley lines are visible as well, and they realize they are back on Exandria in a remote mountainous area. No lights are visible (other than from the sky) but there are the dark shapes of structures near the lake. When they approach, the village appears deserted for years, but from the town clerk's office they discover its name is Ria'Doin on Lake Umamu , in the Caramarin Reach area of Issylra . Meanwhile, Ashton and Chetney investigate the largest home they can find, which appears to have been packed up and cleaned out. Laudna finds records in the clerk's office discussing a recent spate of people abandoning their homes and disappearing in the middle of the night with no warning. The fishmonger reported seeing someone just walk into the lake. FCG casts Speak with Animals and has a tense conversation with a bird which tells him people sometimes come through the village to fill their pockets, but sometimes they, too, just walk into the lake. They decide to spend the night on the second floor of one of the homes, where Chetney uses Detect Magic on the two silver rings taken from the dead Ruby Vanguard soldiers, learning they are both magical, and FCG Identifies one as a Ring of Life Awareness . Chetney then, using the Legendary Toymaker feat gained from his bargain with Nana Morri , crafts a fine toy.\n\n![Orym hugs Imogen by Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d2/Orym_hugs_Imogen_by_Elaine_Tipping.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20240225172446)\n\nImogen and Orym take second watch, and on a whim, Orym tries again to use the sending stone attuned to the one held by Caleb Widogast . To his shock, this time the message goes through, telling the wizard they're in Ria'Doin, a backdoor to the moon. Caleb is also taken aback, saying this magic hasn't worked recently. Imogen then uses Sending to follow up with the name of the lake and asking him to get word to the Resistance. She then contacts Keyleth , telling her they found a secret entrance in Lake Umamu near Ria'Doin leading to subterranean Ruidus. Keyleth is surprised to hear they're no longer on Ruidus, and Imogen explains forces are gathering in Kreviris . Bells Hells will show her the secret tunnel in the lake. Keyleth replies she needs to finish some business and will then try to meet them. Time is starting to run short. Imogen and Orym then realize they may not still be there by the time Keyleth arrives, and discuss how to leave her messages on how to find the portal. Unexpectedly, Orym suddenly gives Imogen a fierce hug, and she reassures him everything is going to be okay before sending a final message to Keyleth: \"The portal is in the lake. We're heading back in the morning. Haven't learned enough. Going to Kreviris. We'll leave markers for you to follow.\" Keyleth responds she'll send a team to see what this secret door in the lake is.\n\n![Jester's Sending - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/cf/Jester%27s_Sending_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20240226004930)\n\nJust then, another voice pushes into Imogen's mind: Jester Lavorre , thrilled beyond words that Sending seems to be back online, saying Caleb told her to contact them. Imogen replies with their location and that they just contacted Lady Keyleth, but Jester doesn't know who that is. She's excited to meet them anyway.\n\nOrym then pulls out his second sending stone and messages Dorian Storm , but there is no response. However, he hears a noise outside he thinks he needs to check on-- it could be Dorian. When Imogen hears about this, she wakes the others and they keep Orym from leaving while Laudna sends Pâté to investigate, but he sees nothing. The party argues, with Chetney suggesting it really might be Dorian while the others are more cautious in light of the villagers' apparent disappearance. Suddenly, Ashton hears something too, followed by FCG and Chetney, who suspect maybe the portal just closed. Worry is driving them to go check. With Hunter's Bane, Chetney senses a presence in the water, possibly an ally.\n\nThe party cautiously moves toward the lake, with the unaffected Fearne, Imogen, and Laudna trying to stop the others. Imogen casts Detect Thoughts toward the lake, and senses an intelligence within it as those affected start wading in. Imogen casts Command on them telling them to return to the house, but it doesn't affect Ashton, and works on the others only for 6 seconds. While their backs are turned, Ashton disappears into the water.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Laudna, Boaty, and Ropy - iwilltryalittlearter](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/49/Laudna%2C_Boaty%2C_and_Ropy_-_iwilltryalittlearter.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20240226004212)\n\nFour members of their party are now trying to dive into the lake. Imogen grabs Orym but is pulled underwater with him. Laudna casts Animate Objects on a sunken boat and a rope, bringing them to life as her mind imbues them with personalities. Climbing aboard the boat, she sends them to bring the charmed party members back. The charmed ones eventually find themselves gently wrapped in seaweed at the bottom of the lake, relaxed and certain they have found the answer that will fix everything. Fearne and Imogen start swimming down toward them, the whole party taking cold damage, and Fearne sees bones scattered among the tendrils of seaweed. Imogen casts Mind Sliver at the kelp and hits it for psychic damage, the tendrils retracting, the creature's hold on Orym, Chetney, and FCG broken. They find themselves alone in cold, dark water, wrapped and held in kelp tendrils, and begin attacking it trying to gain their release, but discover the creature is undead and immune to necrotic damage.\n\nFearne bamfs out Mister and sends him toward FCG , where he teleports them both 15 feet away. Laudna, aboard the diving animated boat, sends the rope toward the remaining captives. Imogen hits again with Mind Sliver . Chetney and Orym free themselves by slashing at the tendrils holding them and start swimming away, but Orym tries to take a skull with him and is recaptured doing so. FCG, hitching a ride with Boaty, the animated boat, uses his Coin of the Changebringer to try Turn Undead but fails. Chetney uses Turmoil to cast Shatter on the creature and he and FCG both reach Laudna's boat. Ashton, however, is still controlled and completely engulfed by the kelp tendrils, and the party is continuing to take cold damage with each round.\n\nOrym is able to free himself and catches a glimpse of Ashton, Misty Stepping to him to free him, but Ashton is still charmed and tries to flee back into the plant's tendrils. FCG uses Turn Undead again, this time succeeding against not only the creature, but Laudna as well. Ashton, however, finally succeeds in escaping the creature's mental control and swims away, and the entire party reaches the surface safely. The boat and rope's animation ends and they sink away.\n\nChetney carves some messages on the porch of the general store and dock, and Orym leaves the skull on the dock holding down the papers they found in the clerk's office. They swim out to the portal, go through it back into the cavern beneath the surface of Ruidus where the group falls asleep with Laudna on watch. Moving away slightly, she calls to Delilah , who immediately responds. Laudna is wondering what is the point of all this, and if she is more of a danger than a help to those she loves. Delilah reassures her that she doesn't give herself enough credit, and she's gotten at least one extra chance at life. But Laudna points out that as she grows stronger, so does Delilah. Delilah counters they are one and the same, but Laudna doesn't believe that. Delilah promises that as Laudna finds more power, Delilah will grant her more, enough to keep Imogen safe. She becomes visible for just a moment, saying gently, \"We will endure. Always.\"\n\nLong rest completed, the party awakens. FCG Identifies the second ring as a Ring of Protection , which Orym takes. Laudna uses the Quintessence Array to suck the magic from the Ring of Life Awareness , giving her a permanent +2 to hit points and advantage on attacks and ability checks till her next long rest. They explore the tunnels holding the proto-elven ruins a bit more, leaving the Ashari symbol as they pass. They speculate as to why Sending apparently came back online but can reach no conclusion. FCG tries to Scry on Ira Wendagoth , but fails. When Orym tries to use the sending stone again to contact Caleb Widogast , that fails as well and the static is back.\n\nThey continue following the tunnel, which they suspect is a bane worm tunnel, until it comes to an abrupt end. At the others' urging, Ashton activates the Shard of Ka'Mort , growing bigger and spikier before merging into the stone. He swims through it, realizing they are not far from the surface. When he rejoins the party, they decide to go up, and he digs a hole to the surface. The party follows, reaching the surface in the middle of a dust storm, and Imogen senses the direction they should travel toward Kreviris. FCG informs the group that the Staff of Dark Odyssey recharged only enough to just cast Teleport by expending all its charges, and if they do that, there's a chance it will disappear. Orym reminds them that their goal is to connect with the Volition . Imogen uses their last Scroll of Mass Nondetection , which lasts eight hours, and uses the Scarf of Intrusive Intent to cast Magic Mouth onto Orym's Message Bloom seed which will trigger if an ally passes nearby, telling them they went to Kreviris and roughly how to get there. Leaving it there, they move on toward the city.\n\nMidway, the ground begins to tremble with energy and brighten, glowing with blinding light as Ruidus flares. Imogen and Fearne become euphoric, part of a timeless essence. Imogen rises into the air, floating, eyes white and hair glowing pinkish red, and all the veins of energy on her body glowing as well. Slowly, the energy subsides and she drifts back to the ground. Both she and Fearne gain 15 temporary hit points. Ashton's transformation ends and he is left exhausted, and Fearne shape changes into a dire wolf.\n\nThey are approaching a mountain range, and in a valley in its middle, they catch a faint view of a city skyline of tall, pointed towers.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e86-doorways_to_darker_depths"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E85-Intense Interrogations","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells had finally climbed the Bloody Bridge from the Malleus Key to the surface of the red moon of ill omen, Ruidus . Upon arriving into a bit of a dangerous scuffle, being pursued by some stragglers, you managed to escape the outpost and head in any direction to try to get to safety. After stopping through the middle of a storm and taking cover, you dove into your own visions and connections with what seems to be Predathos 's power and other Ruidusborn in the region and seemed to triangulate a location where they are converging. Focusing yourselves in that direction, you began to head that way, trying to avoid any dangerous weather patterns, learning a little bit about the strange alien landscape that you're still very fresh in arrival to. Then eventually stumbled upon a little place called Razora , a little village on one of the mountain ranges along the path, not too much of a divergence from the direction you were taking, and there, you went to investigate.\n\nYou encountered some new creature types that you were unfamiliar with, denizens of Ruidus: the bormodos and the cytaas that have a symbiotic relationship. You befriended one of the bormodos who brought you to one of the village elders, known as Elder Barthie . After some discussion, a bit of convincing, you seem to have presented yourselves as allies to those who do not wish the Imperium 's rule to continue to press down upon the free peoples of Ruidus. As such, the Elder seemed to take a liking to you, though warned of it being a dangerous place to flaunt that sort of allegiance, the Imperium taking no quarter. After some lore being spilled, some information about the essential capital of the entire Reiloran society: the Kreviris Imperium resides, the core of it, in the city of Kreviris , which you assume to be the location that you are heading towards.\n\nAlso, a caravan seemed to be coming by, and about the time that this caravan arrived, an entity with the title Willmaster came to the door of the Elder. The Elder seemed surprised, and it took notice of the strange individuals in Vanguard garb within the abode, one transforming into mist and others seeking to immediately make friends by failing to cast a spell upon them. This led to a bit of conflict, a battle here in the middle of the night in the streets outside the elder's abode led to the Willmaster taking all the minds of the surrounding villagers and pulling them in to protect them, as it looked like a few Vanguard members flanked this Willmaster, young and a bit spooked by the sudden violence, as they were exploded by a Fireball . A bunch of loud noises and detonation cracks sent nearby beasts of burden into a frenzy before they broke free of their pen causing a stampede through the center of this town. A number of these figures were either slain or knocked unconscious, and we left off as you had pulled them into the house of the elder, Imogen still a wisp of cloud from Keyleth 's spell still clinging on for another 4-5 hours of length as you all assess how to deal with what comes next.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAs the party finishes dragging the dead and unconscious attackers inside Barthie 's home, Dono leaves and Barthie shows Chetney the trapdoor to the basement. Ashton spreads out the portable hole and they put all the fallen into it. They plan to claim that FCG is a malfunctioning lawn mower that caused the explosion and subsequent stampede. Outside, Orym sees a Juggernaut and several other figures checking out the damage. Laudna , Chetney, and Ashton go down the stairs as there is a knock on the door.\n\n![Evon Hytroga - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/af/Evon_Hytroga_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20240225130433)\n\nOutside are a very pale hooded elf , a juggernaut, and unexpectedly, Evon Hytroga from the Twilight Mirror Museum in Heartmoor Hamlet . He recognizes the group and Imogen convinces him they're part of the Vanguard as well. When he asks if they've brought anything \"fun\" from Exandria , she indicates Fresh Cut Grass, who pretends to be malfunctioning. Evon is missing the creature comforts of home and is very homesick, and Imogen persuades him to let the party join the caravan. The hooded elf with him appears to be in charge, and asks if they've seen the Willmaster . Imogen tells the elf convincingly that the Willmaster left after the stampede and they appear to believe her. Both the elf and Evon take their leave, and Orym realizes that the elf has higher class levels but not quite as many hit points as he does.\n\nThe others rejoin them and Ashton spreads out the hole. As they do, Ashton is hit with an eye-whitening Dominate Person from the Willmaster inside it and attacks Imogen for significant damage. Orym immediately uses Bait and Switch to interpose himself and Imogen telekinetically pulls the hole closed. Ashton, still under the Willmaster's control, stands passively without her commands, and Orym attacks (non-lethally), triggering a save roll that Ashton succeeds at and regains control of himself. With Chetney, Orym, and Ashton ready to attack, they open the portable hole again and Ashton knocks out the Willmaster before she can act. The newly-exalted teenage Vanguard is playing possum, so Chetney ties up and blindfolds both of them as well as the random half-orc soldier.\n\nIn telepathic conversation, they decide to test the Quintessence Array on the Willmaster. Orym agrees to be the test subject and Chetney straps it on him, then holds the Willmaster against the funnel. The harness's runes alight as energy is sucked from the Willmaster into Orym, and he gains the ability to cast Dominate Person once until his next long rest. She is left temporarily without her magical abilities. Ashton begins interrogating her but Laudna uses her Unsettling Presence and takes over. The Willmaster has to remember how to speak aloud and is still unwilling to talk, but Orym uses his Dominate Person to order her to reveal all her secrets. The Willmaster reveals that Predathos is the heart of their people who has made them into what they are. It wants to be awake, to feast. When the gods are gone, Exandria will be theirs. While some would like to live in harmony with Exandrians, others are more violent. The Ruidians are waiting for the gods to be gone since much of Exandria's power for defense comes through them. The spell ends and the Willmaster is furious at being controlled, refusing to speak further, and is returned to the hole.\n\nLaudna proposes using the harness a second time to interrogate the teenaged Exaltant , but the others don't think it's worth the risk of breaking it. Chetney pulls the terrified teen out of the hole, Fearne removes his blindfold, and Imogen gently questions him, learning he's only been on Ruidus a short time. She bonds with him, sharing that she too is an Exaltant and that it's scary, and offers to protect him in place of the Willmaster. When she gives her name, he remembers seeing her mother when he first got to Ruidus. Imogen tells him the Willmaster was a traitor, and the party is a part of the Vanguard, but they need to keep this secret for now. The boy is relieved, but worried about what to tell the caravan, and agrees to all Imogen's suggestions. He also reassures her that the other captured soldier , a half-orc, is a good person and a new recruit as well. They decide to send both of them back to the caravan for now.\n\nHowever, the issue is what to do with the Willmaster, who is too dangerous to be allowed to live, and they realize Orym could continue using the harness on her to drain her entire life force without putting it in danger of breaking. Meanwhile, in the hole, Chetney uses Grim Psychometry on the harness, seeing a vision of himself in a tower chamber, wearing the harness and mage's robes, approaching a beautiful, bound and struggling fey creature like an air nymph. He finishes reading from a book, and looks at the fey, feeling a sense of hunger, and as his servants hold its chains taut, uses the harness to drain its life force as it screams.\n\nThey put Petrov back into the hole and get out Verdo , the half-orc captured soldier. Imogen questions him and learns he knows very little as a new, non- Ruidusborn recruit, but feels loyalty to the Vanguard and to the Martinet . She tells him the Willmaster is a traitor and they'll be joining the caravan to protect everyone, and he buys it. FCG heals him a bit with his next-to-last spell, and Fearne heals Petrov before she and FCG escort them back to the caravan. Inside the encampment, they see a discussion taking place and the two missing soldiers are greeted with relief. The second figure speaks, and they recognize the voice: Otohan Thull has arrived.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![FCG's Banishment - Secret](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/21/FCG%27s_Banishment_-_Secret.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/320?cb=20240217032748)\n\nFCG and Fearne spot Otohan Thull about 15 feet away and panic. Fearne turns and begins casually walking away, while FCG Misty Steps behind a pile of brush. However, they hear Otohan's voice calling to Fearne, who pretends not to hear and keeps walking. Suddenly, Otohan leaps in front of them both, holding her two blades at their throats, and says she's looking for some Exandrians who caused a ruckus here. Fearne plays dumb but Otohan's echoes appear around them. FCG tells Otohan they came to tell her that Imogen wants to talk to her, back at the Bloody Bridge . However, Otohan responds that the reason she's here is that she could feel where Imogen was. Fearne suggests maybe it was her she felt, since Fearne's also Ruidusborn , and this interests Otohan greatly: She's the one \"he\" spoke about. Otohan attacks FCG repeatedly, wounding them and throwing them prone. Fearne tries to intervene, saying Imogen's in Kreviris . FCG telepathically warns the others, telling them to run, before using his last spell slot to cast a 6th level Banishment which Otohan uses a legendary resistance to avoid. However, realizing he can target three creatures with the spell, FCG uses it to banish himself and Fearne to a demi-plane where they immediately begin changing into clouds.\n\n![Laudna and the captive Edmuda - Laura Mackenzie@KiwiDrawer](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/84/Laudna_and_the_captive_Edmuda_-_Laura_Mackenzie%40KiwiDrawer.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/375?cb=20240220145604)\n\nMeanwhile, Ashton starts to gather up the portable hole so they can run, but Laudna stops him, saying the Willmaster shouldn't go to waste and casting Hunger of the Shadow on her. Laudna immediately flashes back to her death on the Sun Tree and feels Delilah 's presence, and the hunger overcomes the slight pity she momentarily feels for the Willmaster. Just before Edmuda dies, Laudna whispers intensely, \"Your power should have been mine and not gone to the halfling!\" Delilah's voice speaks to her approvingly before Laudna grabs the hole and joins the others turning into mist. Ashton knocks out the Elder so he'll have plausible deniability.\n\nFCG and Fearne return just after they've reverted into mist, but the echoes see the mist returning and attack, wounding both. FCG is now seriously hurt but they rocket up out of reach, outrunning Otohan and joining the others. They decide to flee toward Kreviris . Imogen worries that while Otohan didn't seem to know exactly where she was, she did know the general direction they were traveling, speculating it was because she contacted Predathos .\n\nGoing as fast as they can, they encounter another dust storm after about an hour and take shelter in a 230-feet deep cleft in the ground perpendicular to their path. Moving along it as it deepens, they hear water rushing and find an underground river entering a crack in the rock, surrounded by roots and small leafless trees. Forty feet above, Orym spots a small opening, and the party forms a misty chain to explore the tunnel it leads into. The walls and floor are filled with crystals like the inside of a geode, and from somewhere, a bit of water trickles through, forming a pool at the end of the slope.\n\n![The proto-elven ruin - Elaine Tipping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThey all transform back into physical form to explore, and Fearne casts Water Breathing on them. Imogen casts her Dancing Lights under the surface of the pool and they dive in, swimming through an underwater tunnel into another low-ceilinged open space where they encounter a current and deep water. Orym hears splashing water up-current and FCG leads the way that direction to a large open cavern with a 15-foot wide waterfall flowing into the pool. Around it, 80 to 150 feet above them, are the ruins of ancient elven buildings, one appearing to be a temple. Laudna Spider Climbs up with a rope, noticing bits of greenery among the buildings in enchanted gardens, and bits of fossilized humanoid bones along the walls of the cavern, trapped in the moment the city was hurled into space to create the red moon. She uses her immovable rod as a tie-off for the rope and tosses it down for the others to climb up as well.\n\nTogether at the top, they walk along the river and the ruins of the proto-elven city. Chetney uses Grim Psychometry on the bones and ruins but sees only flashes of images of a blue sky turning red. As they walk, they find a garden holding goodberry bushes, which they pick, and a doll, which Laudna takes. They see evidence of slag glass in veins in the cavern walls, as if this area was at one time somehow superheated in places. Eventually, the stones cover more and more of the ruins and they reach a place where the water emerges with a very strong current from a cracked rock. They realize there is no rain on Ruidus but this is a lot of never-ending, fresh water. Orym suggests Fearne wild shape into a salmon, but Fearne chooses a leaf sheep sea slug which succeeds in fighting its way against the current 80 feet up the rocky crack and into the depths of a body of water with light above her. Fearne mentally tells the others what's happened (although for some reason they can't hear her) and swims to the surface, finding herself in a large lake on a cloudy, gray day, surrounded by lush green forests with a faint bit of snow melt on them.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e85-intense_interrogations"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E83-Ruidus (episode)","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after meeting with some of the various important Exandrian figures trying to plot along with you what is happening upon Ruidus and how to stop it, you put yourselves forward as the ones to do this intel mission to figure out as much as you can about the goings-on so the Exandrian forces can plan accordingly when the time is right. In doing so, you rallied yourselves, and with the help of the Voice of the Tempest , you snuck into the Tishtan excavation site once more, seeing them now bolstering their defenses, new technology being incorporated into the surroundings of the Key itself.\n\nYou stealthed past many members of the Ruby Vanguard and the Reiloran defenses. Attempting to climb to the Malleus Key , it seemed that combat was a necessity after some not quite as smooth stealth attempts had transpired, but overall you managed to climb toward the top piecemeal, somewhat rickety map piece of an advancement to the Malleus Key. But in doing so, you damaged and distracted a number of the surrounding guard in the vicinity. You fought the Thought Eater , one of the powerful mystic Reilorans that was guarding this spot behind Otohan Thull who had darted off towards the distraction that had been built by the remaining forces of the Exandrian mines. Upon climbing it, did so while also bringing along with you a possum-transformed Juggernaut . As you all found yourselves being thrust through the energy blast that is the Bloody Bridge , you found yourselves now standing on the surface of the Red Moon of Ill Omen , Ruidus .\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party is on a glowing portal in the middle of a makeshift encampment at the terminus of the Bloody Bridge on Ruidus , accompanied by a possum (a polymorphed Reiloran juggernaut ) which Fearne and FCG quickly push into the Bag of Holding . They spot a couple of Reilorans casually conversing, and the party quickly moves away from the portal toward a tent, which Chetney 's sense of smell reveals holds another Reilora. Behind them, the Reiloran thought eater they had battled moments earlier appears on the terminus point and floats above it, followed shortly by one of the juggernauts. Laudna casts Phantasmal Force on the juggernaut, making him believe he sees three of the party jumping over the surrounding fence, but the thought eater rings an alarm bell and they hear answering howls in the distance, approaching.\n\nLaudna casts a cloud of Darkness at the entrance to the tent and the party begins stealthing through and around it to the surrounding encampment fence. While the juggernaut is initially drawn off by Laudna's spell, he quickly figures out it was a ruse and turns back. The Reiloran in the tent peeks out but quickly pulls back. As the party gathers at the wall, FCG uses the Staff of Dark Odyssey to cast Passwall and create an opening, which Orym moves through and rightward to behind a large rock. Ashton picks up FCG and moves through the opening as well, followed by an Invisible Imogen . The thought eater, however, telekinetically picks up a rock and throws it into the sphere of darkness, injuring Chetney, Laudna, Fearne, and Little Mister .\n\n![Eyeless panthers - ZioCorvid](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/09/Eyeless_panthers_-_ZioCorvid.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20240203130231)\n\nLaudna gets through the hole as well, followed by wolf-form Chetney who makes it all the way to join Orym. (It is at this point that Sam realizes that by using the Staff to cast Passwall , it no longer has enough charges to cast Teleport .) More reilora arrive mounted on scaled eyeless panther-like creatures , and two Ruby Vanguard arrive from the Bloody Bridge. As a distraction, Imogen casts Seething Storm near the darkness area but the thought eater moves toward it and readies another boulder to throw telekinetically. FCG successfully Banishes it just before it can do so.\n\nThe other Reilora continue to converge on the darkened area, but a mounted one leaps over the wall and spots them (still in their Ruby Vanguard robes). FCG Commands him to keep quiet and successfully deceives him into believing they are allies. The alarm is spreading, however, and more enemy forces are gathering. The party tries to act casual and stealthily blend into the crowd, and FCG uses the Coin of the Changebringer to reroll a natural one and succeed. The group manages to reach a small empty tent a slight distance away and duck into it unseen. FCG recasts Telepathic Bond and they begin to shift into mist form using the still-active Wind Walk cast on them by Keyleth as their mission began. Laudna checks her orb attuned to the ring on Otohan Thull and discovers she is nearby somewhere. They can hear the search approaching as they begin fading into mist, with buildings being smashed. They become clouds and filter out from the tent, finding they are completely surrounded by soldiers. The wind is strong and there are dust storms approaching, about 20 minutes away.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Return of the fart clouds - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6a/Return_of_the_fart_clouds_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20240203131110)\n\nWith Chetney and Orym leading the way, in fog form, they head roughly in the direction of the city they had seen from Exandria . With a storm fast approaching, they get as far as they can, spotting a small herd of six-legged multi-horned buffalo-like creatures running quickly into the storm. FCG and Fearne drop behind the others and get a closer look but eventually catch up as the storm nears them. The group finds a small shallow cavern in the base of the mountains to shelter in and revert to their solid forms.\n\n![The sandstorm on Ruidus - SuzySnoo](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/4e/The_sandstorm_on_Ruidus_-_SuzySnoo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20240203132333)\n\nThe cavern shows signs of having been used for shelter previously by others. Chetney uses Grim Psychometry on the fire pit and has a vision of someone being attacked on the plains below by a creature coming up from beneath the surface. They all take a short rest and heal, while FCG bakes and Laudna resummons Pâté . Imogen notices a faint shimmer of red energy in the air surrounding her being drawn slightly toward Fearne, the other Ruidusborn of the group, like a tether. It feels similar to the sense she had at the activation of the Malleus Key of awakened energy. Out of character, Matt tells Laura that Imogen now has a new feature that allows her to share sorcery points and spell slots with other Ruidusborn. After being initially pleased that she and Fearne will have this ability, Imogen begins to wonder if Otohan Thull and her mother could also use it to involuntarily siphon magic from her.\n\nImogen hesitantly suggests she try to connect directly with Predathos . With the others' support, she opens her mind and tries to sense the God Eater, finding herself falling easily towards the presence of a slow, ancient snore with the same sense of welcoming connection she has felt previously, pulling her downward. When it notices her, she hears in her mind, \"Welcome home. Join us. Wake us.\" Her defenses crumble and she allows the presence within. She is pulled onward, seeing hundreds of small red lights in the darkness of various brightness, perhaps two dozen as bright as her own (the Exaltant ), all moving downward, connecting and networking, looking at Imogen and telling her, \"Wake us.\" Imogen successfully resists going deeper, pulling free of the web and finding herself back in the cave, screaming, as her lightning marks brighten and then dim.\n\n![Imogen reaching out to Predathos - Elaine Tipping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen explains Predathos isn't yet fully alive. She doesn't think she'd be able to pull free again, though. Orym tells her that she is their best chance of understanding what's happening, and Laudna intervenes, telling him he's pressuring her. Imogen explains her mother has told her to run from this her entire life, but Orym strongly feels this is something Imogen is going to have to do eventually. Ashton agrees, telling her it's only a matter of whether it's on her terms, or involuntarily. Chetney suggests the Ruidusborn may need Imogen in order to wake Predathos, so maybe they should keep her far away and safe. Imogen realizes she can now sense where the network of Exaltant and Ruidusborn was gathering.\n\nThe storm clears, and Laudna puts Pâté into the Bag of Holding to scout for the possum-juggernaut, but he finds nothing. Eventually, Laudna reaches in for the juggernaut and finds he has died from lack of air but since he is no longer a possum he is too large to come out. FCG cuts him into pieces and they pull most of him out, leaving the torso in the cave but keeping the limbs and head. Ashton brings up the Brood Pit , the seed given to Imogen by All-Minds-Burn back in Bassuras , but Imogen thinks it should be buried deeper down since it's a fungus. FCG passes out his baked apple fritters for 4 temporary hit points each.\n\nThe party transforms back into mist and flitters off, traveling as quickly as possible toward the Ruidusborn network. Eventually, they see the lights of a village of ranches holding many of the buffalo-like beasts. Another storm is approaching in the distance, so they scout the area still in mist form, finding the population is about 1000, scattered among different homes in the mountains. Only about 20% is Reiloran, and the rest are mostly shorter and more squat, a new and different race. There are no Ruby Vanguard, but several Reiloran are wearing similar armor and keeping watch, ordering the people around.\n\nAshton tries to look like a dirt devil but only draws attention to himself. As night falls, they decide to send their most charismatic members, Imogen and Laudna, into town to approach a resident. Eventually they find one of the short, squat figures tending to his animals, and they all go into his storage shed. Everyone but Orym and Chetney begins changing out of cloud form as the figure finishes his work, approaches, and enters the shed, lighting up a medallion so he can see. Imogen and Laudna urge him not to scream and he asks, in Common , who they are.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e83-ruidus_(episode)"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E84-Red Rural Revelations","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after fighting and sneaking their way to the center of the Tishtan excavation site , stepped upon the Bloody Bridge and found yourselves transported to the surface of the Red Moon of Ill Omen , Ruidus itself. Upon arriving, you used the still-lingering spell from Keyleth , the Air Ashari , to transform into mist, once you had managed to escape a brief encounter at the center of the receiving encampment on the moon, and managed to evade discovery long enough to escape over the windy and dust-covered landscape.\n\nUpon traveling and traversing to a region that seemed safe, you found a cavern where you could rest and collect your thoughts. Imogen reached her mind out to try to connect to the weird drawing essence of the very moon that you stand on. In doing so, you seemed to draw some attention, but learned some very important things, as you now continue to seek information about what's happening here, what's important about it, who's responsible, and what you can bring back that might offer an advantage to all those that lie in wait on Exandria . You continued on through a storm, met some of the local wildlife from a distance, and then settled down in a mountain-nestled village , where it seemed a lot of farm folk and livestock were being tended to, gathered in a very simple life, still with a Reiloran presence, some working, some walking with authority. But here in the shadow, five of your troop have traveled down into one of the little farm sections, an offshoot of the village proper, and began to transform back into your physical selves from the mist form within a storage structure of some kind. Upon nearly completing your transference, an entity walked in and noticed, about to squeal for a moment. You shouted towards it to stay quiet, and through a brief moment of persuasion, the tension seems to have been abated or not crossed over into anything dangerous.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Dono - Lilith Wu](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5a/Dono_-_Lilith_Wu.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20240211135415)\n\nThe short figure is at first very startled, fearful, and confused. Laudna immediately tells him they're there to help against the Ruby Vanguard , and by casting Detect Thoughts Imogen learns he is afraid this is a test of his loyalty to the Imperium because the party is still wearing their Ruby Vanguard clothing. They assure him they hate the Imperium and learn his name is Dono . Fearne notices him whispering toward his chest and Laudna sees movement there, and when Fearne Druidcrafts a flower and gives it to him, he hands it immediately to a second set of long, thin arms coming from his chest for inspection. A small iguana-like humanoid crawls out and also inspects it, eventually eating it. Dono introduces it as Kaniey, a very young cytaa .\n\nDono is afraid because they are not supposed to talk to the Dreamers (their word for those from Exandria ) when they come through. His people, the bormodos , bond with the cytaa symbiotically, and he (and many other bormodos) have learned common through Exandrians' dreams, which they share instead of themselves dreaming. As \"simple farm folk\", Dono suggests taking them to Elder Barthie in the village for their more complicated questions, although he does mention that several Imperium supervisors left about three days ago, and that there has recently been a push for much greater production, creating some tension.\n\nDono agrees to lead them to Barthie's home, and the group alerts Orym and Chetney (still in mist form) to this. They all change into mist and move into the darkened village, where Orym spots two guard reilora and determines they are not as powerful as he is. Once at Barthie's, Dono cautiously knocks and is eventually admitted, although Barthie seems annoyed with him. Still in mist form, the party follows and re-apparates. When Barthie asks for evidence of their allegiances, Chetney produces the juggernaut head from the Bag of Holding , which Barthie finds convincing.\n\nOrym and FCG explain they're in search of information and would be happy to trade information about Exandria. Barthie shares that the Imperium has been around for at least 500 years. As far as anyone knows, Ruidus has always been there, and so have the bormodo, carved from its rock by The One Who Sleeps and shaped to be a reflection of the dreams they share with Exandrians. Until recently, the bormodo thought Exandria was the place they'd go when they died, and that one day, everyone would be able to leave Ruidus for Exandria.\n\n![Cytaa - ZioCorvid](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/ea/Cytaa_-_ZioCorvid.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20240209220445)\n\nImogen learns there are fungal farms under the city of Kreviris , the capital of the Imperium. Barthie also has a question: What do pastries taste like? The party gives him one, but a hand reaches out from from his shawl and grabs it, eating it rapidly. Barthie introduces his cytaa, Chu , who is more suspicious of the party than her symbiote. She wants to know their plans. When they promise not to hurt Barthie, she warms a little but doubts Exandrians would welcome the Ruidians with open arms when the party says they'd be welcome there. At Chetney's inquiry, she tells them that bormodo must be properly escorted in order to enter Kreviris, the capital.\n\nThey learn a trade caravan to Kreviris was due a few days ago, but hasn't yet arrived, and Kreviris is a few days' travel away through several reiloran checkpoints. Despite Chu's warning, Barthie shares that he has a few friends that the party might be able to talk to about traveling there. Because of the Imperium's doubled demands on the village, Willmaster Edmuda has been sent there to enforce the demands on behalf of the Dominion of Cruth 's disciplinary division, The Will. His friend, Zhesh , is a secret member of the Volition , a resistance group, and it's possible Zhesh will be with the expected caravan and can help the party get into Kreviris. Laudna and Chetney transform themselves to look like Ludinus Da'leth and Otohan Thull , and Barthie has seen both of them, several weeks ago with the initial wave of dreamers. Barthie describes Zhesh and gives them a piece of semi-opaque \"sub glass\" like turquoise obsidian, which is the \"glass of the land\", used to craft strong tools and implements. Zhesh is a master shaper of such glass. Barthie shares that the barmolo refer to a flare of the moon as a beat of the heart of the One Who Sleeps. When one occurs, the ground illuminates with near-blinding red light and everyone shares a euphoric unified dream in a spiritual connection.\n\nChetney offers to do any favors or odd jobs Barthie needs done, and Barthie expresses interest in A Taste of Tal'Dorei so is gifted a pencil and a toy sword. They debate whether to leave for Kreviris now, while they can use fog form, or wait for the caravan to arrive. While Imogen prepares to Send to Zhesh to confirm if she's with the caravan, Orym and Chetney scan outside. Orym spots a number of lanterns converging at the edge of the village where the road enters, and they send Dono to see if it's the caravan. It is, so Imogen casts Sending , telling Zhesh they're with Barthie and would love to speak to her. She responds cautiously that she's just here to do business. They decide to send Barthie to her, and Imogen begins turning into a mist cloud again. But as Barthie starts to open the door, there is a loud knock and the door is pulled out of his hands. Outside is a tall, thin reiloran: Willmaster Edmuda .\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nMost of the party dives behind furniture, trying mostly unsuccessfully to hide. The Willmaster looks in, seeing a partially transformed Imogen (therefore out of action for the next several rounds) and various body parts of the others sticking out. FCG invites her in and casts Fast Friends , but it fails to affect her and initiates combat. Edmuda steps back slightly revealing multiple Ruby Vanguard soldiers accompanying her, plus two shrikes .\n\nNot knowing what they're doing yet, Orym simply pushes Barthie back and guards him. However, Laudna Hexes the Willmaster, then casts Fireball on the group of figures outside. Most of them take full damage, but the opportunity to negotiate is gone. One of them, a teenage boy , suddenly bursts into a familiar blast of purplish-white energy, [1] a newly awakened Exaltant who immediately uses Telekinesis on Laudna to lift her off the ground slightly. Chetney casts Shatter on Edmuda and a shrike, while Ashton enters a Gravity rage and uses Erratic Defense to gain resistance against a shrike attack, teleporting it 30 feet away before whacking another enemy twice. The Willmaster's eyes flare initiating her Meat Shield, and every one of the villagers present rush in to the battle before she flings a Jagged Dart at Ashton. Edmuda fails a save against Fearne 's Charm Person , but nonetheless refuses to come inside at her request. FCG fires their grapple cannon toward Edmuda, but she uses her Meat Shield ability to interpose an innocent farmer, who is pulled inside toward FCG who guiltily takes half the farmer's damage.\n\n![Orym casting Hex - Jenny Dolfen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/07/Orym_casting_Hex_-_Jenny_Dolfen.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20240210222211)\n\nOrym's eyes go deep green and he casts Hex on Edmuda, causing small black flowers and tendrils to emerge from her chest, then attacks. On his second and third strikes, the Meat Shield causes him to hit villagers instead, but he action surges to grapple and elbow her. In retaliation, the shrikes surround him and attack for massive damage, then disappear from Ashton's sight. Laudna casts Mirror Image , then Ray of Frost at Edmuda. The new teen Exaltant Blights Laudna, and another soldier hits her with a crossbow bolt. Chetney transforms into wolf form and knocks out the only remaining potential Meat Shield, then attacks the Willmaster and Ashton knocks her out, leaving two shrikes, two Vanguard, and the Exaltant. FCG casts Calm Emotions on the shrikes and uses a healing potion on an unconscious villager.\n\nOrym transfers his Hex to the exaltant and knocks him out. The shrikes calmly lift the Willmaster's body and begin moving away, but Orym trips one and Laudna kills the other with Eldritch Blast . Spooked, several wuukor break out of their corral and stampede forward, while the two remaining Vanguard run off. Chetney kills the shrike with a claw attack, and Ashton pulls two villagers out of the way of the stampede. Fearne kills one of the fleeing Vanguard with Scorching Ray , while Imogen finally finishes transforming into a mist cloud and flies up to see multiple villagers coming to investigate the noise. FCG uses Stone Shape to shield themself and a villager from the stampede. Orym runs toward the fleeing soldier, pulls him back with Seedling 's vines, and knocks him out. The wall of stone created by FCG diverts the cattle, which run off.\n\nBarthie comes out of his home and asks in bewilderment what their plan is. The party pulls the bodies into the Elder's home and sets out the portable hole , while figures begin converging on the uproar from the edges of the village.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e84-red_rural_revelations"}

In doing so, had to regather themselves, rebuild some trust, and Fearne , who particularly had been emotionally wounded in this endeavor, wanted to revisit her Nana Morri . The group went to the Fey Realm , back to Ligament Manor , where some reunions with your parents also came with some revelations about your true nature, and a number of group-building exercises were developed via Nana Morri and FCG , in which you all proved yourselves to be on the path to recovery. Some work has been done, with some work still left before you, but, feeling a little more confident about your troupe, you've returned, and Fearne decided to take the Spark of Rau'shan into herself. Through the ritual's completion, you embraced the fiery shred of the ancient primordial fire titan , and upon making contact with Ashton , awoke the shard within him. The two of you now coming into full realization of the power and the spiritual essence that you both carry and have bonded to, you rushed out of the garden at the top of Ligament Manor while the rest of your group were left to ruminate on what they just witnessed.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe group goes over their plan that Nana Morri will handle the time dilation around their trip to the Fey Realm while Allura Vysoren handles their physical transportation back to Exandria and the Malleus Key . FCG asks Laudna how she's doing and learns she believes Delilah won't be drawn to the Spark of Rau'shan any longer now that Fearne has absorbed it. The group also talks about boons they might seek from Nana Morri. Chetney is considering asking to be young again even if it comes with conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Fearne and Ashton are outside exploring their new powers and abilities. Fearne tries Scorching Ray on Ashton's spell-splitting hammer and they realize they could come up with creative joint attacks. Ashton can will himself to sink into natural, unworked rock or earth as if it were water (although he must surface to breathe), while Fearne is surrounded by flame to the extent her physicality is hard to discern and she ignores the difficulties of the terrain. While he is transformed into his elemental state, Ashton's constant pain is virtually gone but returns when he drops the form. He explains to Fearne that he does better with firm contact, part of why he enjoys the punk culture. His demonstrated firm hug results in minor fire damage, which he happily accepts. The two slowly walk back to Ligament Manor .\n\n![Chetney, dreaming of toys - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/dc/Chetney%2C_dreaming_of_toys_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231225202347)\n\nMeanwhile, Chetney goes to talk to Nana Morri, naming the magical doorway Sir Push-Pull on the way. Initially, he suggests his request is to never die, but after some discussion, he tells her his passion is toys and he wants to be the most famous toy maker the world has ever known, In return, Morrigan requests a piece of the god-eater . The deal is sealed, with Morrigan promising to make Chetney \"notorious\". When he returns to the others, he refuses to tell them what his deal was and what he promised, but Fearne's enthusiastic about the idea.\n\nBefore they sleep, FCG presents the rolls he's baked: a Heroes Yeast for the party, Allura , Pâté , and Little Mister . Imogen suggests they follow her into her dreams, so that she can try giving into the pull of Ruidus , and Orym , Laudna , and Ashton volunteer. Imogen sleeps, and the others follow her dream up the Bloody Bridge to the red storm on the surface of the red moon. Opening her mind, she senses others just out of reach and feels the familiar beckoning. Touching the ground, she thinks, \"Bring me home,\" and stops fighting the beckoning, drifting into darkness. While the others sense dread, Imogen feels comfort as she drifts into caverns, oceans, and life forms beneath the surface. She hears her mother's voice saying, \"Imogen, no!\" The others lose sight of her and wake up, but in the darkness, Imogen senses an immense, powerful presence like that she felt when Laudna died and she exploded, [1] but also senses she belongs here. She wakes a moment later than the others, and Orym (with a natural 20 insight check) gets a whisper about her feelings. She tells the others it felt good. Chetney uses the Monocle of True Essence but sees nothing suspicious.\n\n![Orym's bargain with Nana Morri - Ofteasandherbs](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/92/Orym%27s_bargain_with_Nana_Morri_-_Ofteasandherbs.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20240111174100)\n\nAfter the others are asleep, Orym visits Nana Morri alone. He feels the least ready of the group, and wants them all back safe. He requests Morri make him more capable of protecting them—his passion is to protect his friends. He offers to serve her if they see their mission through, and all return alive and as they are. Morri accepts, and the deal is made. She tells him to call upon her when they need some help. Rejoining the others, Orym curls up against the sleeping Fearne.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nIn the morning, they breakfast with the Calloway family and Nana Morri , with FCG unwittingly consuming a silver egg holding multiple souls. Ollie Calloway admits the Squint has left him since the Apogee Solstice . Farewells are said, and with Morri's aid to deal with the time aspects of their travel, Allura transports them across planes back to Exandria and the Hellcatch Valley , within sight of a bustling fort, the Bloody Bridge , and the looming red orb of Ruidus .\n\n![The tethered moon - Eye of the Newt](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b3/The_tethered_moon_-_Eye_of_the_Newt.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20231225202928)\n\nThe group enters the encampment. Allura is greeted by Mythtaker Qi Mandozi , an orcish spellcaster from Aeshanadoor , Tofor Brotoras , a one-armed silver dragonborn paladin and fellow member with Allura on the Tal'Dorei Council , and Earthbreaker Groon , an elderly human from Vasselheim in Issylra with a connection to Kord the Stormlord . They welcome the party, who are expected, and introductions are made. Groon gives Fearne a long, measured look with his pupil-less white eyes as they are ushered into the War Tent, where Lord Percival and Keyleth are working.\n\nThe council begins. Keyleth welcomes Bells Hells, telling them their anonymity is valuable, but those present recognize their abilities. Mythtaker Qi reports on the rise of several doomsday cults around the world, while Bratoras discusses the rise of the Ruby Vanguard . Percival has designed what they call \"butcher wagons\", which Allura and Mandozi will use in a feint assault on the northwestern side of the Malleus Key , hoping to draw attention there where the butcher wagons can be detonated, giving Bells Hells 10-30 minutes to infiltrate from the southeast. \"The smartest\" of the defending Ruby Vanguard forces are currently on Ruidus, and Bells Hells' previous attack disabled the site's magic dispelling pulses. However, the Reilora can sense nearby minds. Groon urges them to do their best not to be discovered, but if they are, leave no witnesses, however they can accomplish that. They will need to cover their tracks upon arrival, as well. Allura tells them to learn as much as they can about the Reilora, Ludinus Da'leth 's location and plans, and the potential dangers of an assault on the red moon.\n\nFearne approaches Groon and asks why he looked at her. He responds she, and Imogen , are Ruidusborn . Qi and Tofor react with shocked surprise, but Keyleth assures them that these two are not bound by the draw that caused previous Ruidusborn operatives to forget their purpose and join the opposing forces. Groon trusts they are capable, \"for if they turn, the storm will find them.\" Orym assures The Tempest that they're ready, and choosing them wasn't a mistake. They agree to meet in an hour to start the operation.\n\nWhen Bells Hells are alone, Imogen admits the pull of Ruidus is very strong, and stronger since her dream. Laudna goes to talk privately to Keyleth, noting she seems distracted. Keyleth admits she is focused on setting Vax'ildan free, although her primary motivation is saving the world from this new threat. Vax is being used to power the Bloody Bridge , the only way to connect to the otherwise magically-shielded Ruidus, and it needs to stay in place until this conflict is resolved. Keyleth apologizes, for everything, and walks away.\n\n![Imogen's encounter with Groon - David Garcia](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFCG casts Telepathic Bond on all of them, while Imogen casts Mage Armor . She suddenly feels the hand of Earthbreaker Groon on her shoulder, but when she telepathically asks if she can help, the reply is a different, sourceless, growling voice, telling her: \"You have my eye. There is greatness in you. Do not let us down.\" She hears the sound of thunder in the cloudless sky.\n\nSlightly later, Keyleth joins them and Percival activates the distraction wagons. Imogen uses one of the two Scrolls of Mass Nondetection on the party, while Keyleth casts Wind Walk and they all fly upward, seeing the base of the Malleus Key and the feint illusionary assault on it. Keyleth tells them they have a few minutes to gather their thoughts, as a violent storm begins to brew over the Hellcatch around them. The party puts on their Ruby Vanguard uniforms as Fearne casts Pass Without Trace on them. FCG casts Death Ward on Imogen. Keyleth warns them that their cloud form provides some protection, but they are sitting ducks during their transformation back.\n\nAs they move forward, Fearne guides them toward the base of the Bridge. The thunder grows in intensity, and they hear horns coming from  around them in the site, but they stealthily avoid detection as the feint attack begins, opposed by Reiloran warriors, juggernauts, and hulking automaton Warders .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e81-the_eve_of_the_red_moon"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E35-Pyrrhic Return","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after chasing down Armand Treshi to Bassuras , finally located him and went into the Seat of Disdain , the fortress where he'd been held. Upon absconding with him and getting caught in a bunch of chaos, you encountered The Legend of the Peaks herself, Otohan Thull , the war hero who seems to be tied up in this odd Ruidus business. Upon an attempted conversation turning into a fray, turning into a bloodbath, three of your party fell dead, two of which were salvaged and one who could not be: Laudna .\n\nNow, having fled, or seemingly banished for the time being the individual that took the lives of your friends, Otohan, scattered somewhere to the four winds, you have Laudna's body. You finished your business in Bassuras. You've called ahead via the Sending spell to Jrusar , and with her body in tow in hopes of possibly bringing her back, should time and resources be with you, you called the skyship The Silver Sun back, jumped upon its rapidly moving ladders up into the sky, climbed up into the air, and said adieu to Bassuras on the south end of the Hellcatch Valley .\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nCaptain Xandis welcomes them aboard and they direct the ship toward Jrusar , quickly. Ashton releases Armand Treshi from the portable hole , and Treshi tells them he was smuggled to Bassuras via skyship to hide out and lay low. He offers them 10,000 gold (later raised to 13,000) if they don't take him to Jrusar. Imogen delves into his mind, learning that he was trying to use Paragon's Call to better his political position in Jrusar. He was also involved in the movement of \"certain goods\" within the city, meeting with people from overseas coastal towns about the smuggling, and taking particular interest in the shipments to Jiana Hexum . She also learns he is deeply afraid of the people he's been working with and fled to Paragon's Call for protection and on a promise they would help him salvage his reputation, but that he feared their betrayal. He would like to get as far away as possible. The group decides to keep him in the ship's \"mold storage\" room during the voyage.\n\nImogen recovers the tracking orb from Laudna 's body, hoping to find the location of the ring Laudna had attempted to plant on Otohan Thull , but it is dark. FCG suggests two possible pending tasks: go to Yios and the Grim Verity , and further explore the Gorgynei . Orym points out that Laudna is their current priority, and they list their possibilities to deal with it: Lord Eshteross , Jiana Hexum, Ajit Dayal , Delilah Briarwood , The Voice of the Tempest , and the Lord and Lady of Whitestone . Orym tells the group that Delilah once did terrible things under Whitestone's castle.\n\nImogen Sends to Keyleth, telling her they've found the assassins and a lead, but there are questions and one of them with strong ties to Whitestone is down. Can they meet? Keyleth responds that she's currently on business in Vasselheim but can meet \"shortly\". Fresh Cut Grass Sends to Jiana Hexum (although Ashton is uncomfortable about it), saying Ashton has a friend who died and asking if Jiana can help bring her back. Jiana's response: \"Sweet little metal boy. What you ask is extremely difficult and against the nature of fate. Maybe.\" FCG asks the potential cost and she suggests a discussion over tea. The group points out that the cost is likely to be FCG, but FCG thinks maybe that's reasonable. Ashton firmly says it's not, and there will be no more talk of it. With night falling, they go to sleep, but Chetney stays on deck to look at the moons . He finds himself howling instinctually toward them and sees fur push past his fingers before receding.\n\n![The Skyship Silver Sun - Wesley Griffith](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/82/The_Skyship_Silver_Sun_-_Wesley_Griffith.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220924064216)\n\nThe next day, a massive sandstorm quickly approaches and overtakes the skyship. As the party tries to help the crew, one of the sails is torn and partially lost, but they pull in the opposite sail to match. FCG enhances Xandis's ability to steer the ship lower down to miss the worst of the storm. Imogen calms the crew, but Fearne 's attempt to help Xandis with Guidance fails, and as a strong gust hits, another sail tears away and FCG is blown overboard. They impact hard as they hit the ground. The ship angles upward to get above the storm but all of the remaining party members except Ashton also fall off and take significant damage. Ashton frantically tells the captain to turn around, but they must wait out the storm first.\n\nOn the ground, the party is scattered. Fearne shouts for the others, then begins playing on her pan flute as the others head toward the sound. She notices vibrations around her and realizes she is sinking into the sand, but is able to use a Mirthful Leap to escape the large, claw-like pincers rising around her. However, as FCG approaches they both find themselves sinking. Imogen Misty Steps and then casts Fly on FCG, lifting them both into the air. Orym runs to Fearne and uses Bait and Switch to get between her and the sand creature, then pushes her away up the slope. Orym wedges his shield inside its mouth. When Imogen flies back down to Orym, Fearne uses Stonky's Ring to pull the shield free and Imogen and he fly upward to safety. FCG uses his propeller arm to fly to and rescue Chetney, while Ashton descends a rope ladder from the hovering ship and helps push Fearne aboard.\n\nWith everyone back safely on the ship, Chetney volunteers to help fix the wood damage to the Silver Sun as they fly onward toward Jrusar.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Jrusar at sunset - Ulfvaee](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a5/Jrusar_at_sunset_-_Ulfvaee.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20220926122819)\n\nThe next day, another sandstorm approaches but this one blows toward Jrusar , shaving a day off their journey. After two more uneventful days, they reach the city at sunset. Ashton puts Armand Treshi back into the portable hole , while Orym leaves the ornate spyglass Fearne had stolen from Captain Xandis on their last voyage [1] in an easily noticeable spot in the cargo hold. They bid farewell to Xandis and head toward Lord Eshteross 's home.\n\nOn the way, Fresh Cut Grass again asks Fearne for the return of his Changebringer coin. At first she denies knowing what he's talking about, then denies taking it, then denies knowing where it is. Finally, FCG casts Detect Object and takes it from her. She wants to melt it because she doesn't like its association with Laudna 's death. FCG helps her understand where the motivation for her constant pickpocketing might be coming from.\n\nWhen they reach Eshteross's home, it is dark and the windows are boarded, but Orym sees movement at a second-story window. They knock, and after a long moment it unlocks but no one appears. When Imogen Sends to Eshteross, he responds he wasn't certain it was them and comes down to escort them through the heavily booby-trapped manor to a safe room. Ashton spreads out the portable hole and shows Eshteross they have Treshi. Eshteross suggests two possible next steps: deliver him anonymously to the wardens , or take him directly to Orlana Sheshadri and get credit (and the bounty) for his capture. He asks that if they make that choice, they tell Sheshadri that Eshteross is a friend of her cause and that the group is acting as his emissaries. Eshteross, however, has no leads on resurrection magic for Laudna, although he has a friend named Manaia Turei in the Parlor of the Collective of Bodhan (city infrastructure department) who could transport them if that's necessary. He also pays them for returning Treshi to the city.\n\nImogen Sends to Keyleth again asking her help. Keyleth is nearly finished with her business and will see what she can do. Orym shares with the group that both his husband Will and his father-in-law Derrig were killed in the attack on Zephrah by the shadow assassins and unable to be resurrected, for unknown reasons. Imogen tells Eshteross about the cage around Ruidus and the city on its surface, and Orym adds that Otohan Thull and the Cerberus Assembly seem to be connected. Eshteross reacts to that with both interest and fear. Ashton adds that the Assembly has been smuggling residuum and shows him a Potion of Possibility , mentioning that Jiana Hexum is also involved.\n\nThey leave Laudna 's body with Eshteross (after taking her magical items) and go immediately to Sheshadri to deliver Treshi. She is very pleased and Treshi is resigned. They tell her Lord Eshteross sends his regards, and she pays them the bounty of 12,000 gold. They also tell her about Ira Wendagoth 's role in recent events in Jrusar and that he's partnered with Otohan and the Cerberus Assembly, but with no proof of the Assembly's involvement she remains dubious.\n\n![Ashton's potential - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/88/Ashton%27s_potential_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220928143931)\n\nThey head to the Spire by Fire Inn for the night. At Ashton's request, Imogen and FCG jointly cast Detect Thoughts on Ashton in an attempt to recover more memories of the night the Nobodies broke into Jiana Hexum's home and Ashton was left gravely injured or possibly dead. Ashton's memories are familiar, the story of his injury and repair, and the use of a Potion of Possibility sealed into his head. They push further but Imogen is blocked by a glass-like wall similar to the glass in Ashton's head as FCG continues. Gradually, it fills with swirling star-filled grey mist. She gets flashes of disconnected images of Ashton, an infinite number of potential Ashtons, none of them the one they know, some injured as he is, some not, some with normal skin rather than his rocky form. Ashton's nose begins to bleed, and Chetney touches FCG and Imogen, trying to alert them to the danger.\n\nImogen experiences fear similar to the first time she ran from the red storm of her dreams. FCG is seeing Ashton's memories of that night through Ashton's eyes, and suddenly realizes Imogen is not there. He calls out to her with no answer, and when he retraces his steps he hits the wall of glass and cannot pass. He finds himself trapped in a series of crystal chambers. Ashton, meanwhile, is trapped in the moment he saw the white flash of the trap exploding. Imogen is able to push through the barrier and hears FCG calling, finding him on the other side of the glass wall, but when FCG looks down, his body looks like Ashton's. He realizes that Ashton is in almost constant pain when he moves. Imogen tells him to concentrate on pushing through. FCG casts Command on himself/Ashton, saying, \"Awake,\" but it fails. Imogen casts Sending on Ashton, telling them this isn't real and they need to calm down and relax, but it also fails. When Fearne looks into the glass in Ashton's head, she sees two tiny figures floating there.\n\nAshton begins to become aware of the invasion within his mind and tries to hit himself, but is too woozy and fails. Imogen once more Commands \"Wake up!\" The glass around them shatters and they all find themselves back in the tavern room, realizing the Potion of Possibility is what gave Ashton his powers, and that they definitely don't want to try that again. Privately, Imogen tries Sending to Delilah Briarwood , asking again how to bring Laudna back, and Delilah responds faintly: \"Whatever it takes. It won't be long now. I'm fading. And I'll take her with me.\" Exhausted, the party goes to sleep with Chetney keeping watch.\n\nIn the morning, they go pick up Laudna's body from Eshteross and then to the beautiful Aerie Spire where they seek out Manaia Turei . Within a small forest surrounded by the offices of the Collective of Bodhan, she greets them and they explain they're from Lord Eshteross seeking transportation. Imogen decides to try Sending to Keyleth one more time asking where she is, but Keyleth asks where they are. In a few moments, there is a flash of green light, a tree pushes apart, and Keyleth steps out.\n\n![Keyleth and Bells Hells - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOrym hails her, thanks her, and apologizes for pulling her away. He explains the situation, mentioning Keyleth crossed paths with Laudna once, in Whitestone. FCG explains they are Bells Hells, an adventuring party trying to do good, which Keyleth notes sounds familiar. She looks down at the body of Laudna and goes still, after a moment saying, \"We need to speak with someone. Someone who can help you.\" She re-opens the rift in the tree and through it they glimpse the town of Whitestone and its castle. They all rush through.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e35-pyrrhic_return"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E32-A Stage Set","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells were in the city of Bassuras chasing down Armand Treshi , a fugitive from the Mahaan House Treshi in Jrusar , who seemed to have been caught up in a number of problems in the city mainly involving this Shade Mother business, and was turned in by Lady Emoth after you had turned her in. He fled the city and you've been chasing him ever since.\n\nUpon arriving here in the city of Bassuras in the middle of the Hellcatch Valley , you also uncovered a number of interesting elements, one, that he is holed up within the Seat of Disdain , the house of power, the fortress of power for the Paragon's Call that he was so entwined with. You also managed to have a strange run-in with an assassin that was revealed chasing down the Calloways , revealing themself when you met Birdie Calloway . You then traveled with Birdie along to a secret laboratory where she and Ollie , Fearne's father, had been allied with another strange ally of Treshi's that you had encountered once before, Ira Wendagoth , the Nightmare King. It seemed that the Calloway family had been working while she was being kept by her \"grandmother\" Morri , Morrigan, in the Feywild , to understand the nature of the red moon Ruidus , which it seems your friend Fearne here was born under.\n\nNow, as part of this interest in ascertaining its nature in hopes of protecting their child from its strange continuous apparition within the fey realm, Ira seemed to have acquired the item he needed that you had delivered from Morri to complete this device that the Calloways had been completing with him, and then he absconded with this information, before revealing some other odd connections to other weird mysteries that float about the continent of Marquet . Some tense encounters and realizations with your parents, Fearne, and a possible path to reconciliation. At the very least getting everything out in the open. It was decided that Ollie would stay back while Birdie would take you on her crawler alongside yours back to the city of Bassuras to look into some of this Treshi business.\n\nYou also discovered upon reaching out, Fresh Cut Grass , to Dancer , that it seemed there was some tension in the past you weren't aware of, an emotional request to not find them. Realizing that you may have been responsible in some way, shape, or form, for the dire end of your previous group , you reached a threshold of stress and tension and began to assault your friends. In this brief altercation, you managed to calm Fresh Cut Grass, and in these tense realizations and hurled insults the rest of you sat there a bit scattered, broken and confused. You, Laudna , dealing with the reemerging influence of one Delilah within yourself and what that draw might mean should you give into it. It seems that the only functional mind at the moment, as pointed out by Ashton , is Orym , and the rest of you have some shit to work out. But, after spending a night of rest here in the laboratory, shortly after sunrise you once again stood onto the crawler that you had purchased and had worked on by Imahara Joe , alongside Birdie's crawler, and then rode off into the dusty desert of the Hellcatch back towards the city.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party arrives in Bassuras without incident. Birdie heads back to the secret lab for safety, after hesitantly hugging Fearne . Fresh Cut Grass wants to talk to Dancer , so Imogen Sends to her, saying, \"Dancer. We've captured your automaton. Preparing to disassemble. Where can we meet, if you're interested in recouping some costs? We're in Bassuras.\" Dancer replies for them to meet her at the Revel and Break, a drinking establishment in The Undercarriage. FCG gives their buzzsaw arm to Orym (who wraps it in a cloak and carries it under an arm) and Fearne ties FCG up.\n\n![Dancer meeting with FCG - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d6/Dancer_meeting_with_FCG_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220905013532)\n\nAt the tavern, Orym, Imogen, and Ashton enter while the others stay outside. Dancer is at a table and willing to talk, and Orym gives her the buzzsaw arm. Dancer confirms she didn't build FCG but bought and then repaired him with weeks of tinkering. She agrees to go outside where FCG apologizes to her and asks her for more information about his origin, but she knows little. When she got him running, he already was cheerful, took care of people, and knew how to heal. She doesn't know if he could earn her forgiveness, and wants FCG far away from her, because it could happen again. The night he broke, he'd been acting a little strangely, having gone through \"a few rougher scuffs\", and then snapped, killing the entire Division of Public Benefit and nearly killing Dancer, who narrowly escaped. She describes a runic cable deep in FCG's interior, which if disconnected would seriously incapacitate him. Saying goodbye, FCG is anxious for her to take care of herself and to find someone to talk to. She gives him back his buzzsaw arm and suggests they talk to Imahara Joe about FCG's metal-masked seller .\n\nThe party goes to Joe's, where Chetney buys some metallic paints and magnets to get the metal out of them. Imogen asks about the trader who sold FCG to Dancer. They've come through about three times in the past few years. They are tall and masculine-presenting, wearing a \"really intricate metal mask\" and a dark hooded cloak, going by the name \" D \" and selling various ancient bits and pieces of ancient pre-Calamity arcane machinery they say they find buried in the Rumedam Desert .\n\nImogen asks about the runic cable, a \" ley tether\", that Dancer described inside FCG, and Joe is familiar. Someone at a university might know more, but Joe knows quite a bit. He excitedly agrees to look inside FCG, and FCG is willing, though nervous. Joe discovers transmutation magic transforms the fuel FCG consumes, and when he looks further he finds the tether. When Laudna attempts to read the runes on it, Delilah Briarwood 's voice says there's nothing there of interest to her. Joe confirms it's properly installed and everything looks as intended, but is nervous exploring any further.\n\n![Imahara Joe investigating FCG - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/53/Imahara_Joe_investigating_FCG_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20220905013812)\n\nLaudna shares that FCG recently had a murderous incident and Joe fetches a book that discusses \"The Care and Culling\", an event during the Age of Arcanum during which automatons acting as caretakers and helpful companions were created and distributed throughout Exandria by Aeorian political figures to their rivals as ostensible peace offerings. The aeormatons suddenly killed the people they had been gifted to, making Aeorian technology henceforth incredibly suspect. FCG is shaken, believing they must be one of those assassin Aermatons gifted to someone in Marquet , but Joe and Orym reassure them that what's important is what they want to become.\n\nThe party returns to questioning Joe about the mysterious \"D\", and Imogen, with Joe's permission, Detects Thoughts to see his memories of D. He remembers the cloak and hood, the figure walking alongside a crawler-pulled cart. The figure's mask is intricately made of bits of metal and he wears leather boots. Before they leave, Joe gifts the still-shaken FCG a medallion of the Changebringer , saying he hopes it will help FCG find the right path.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Balloon Imogen - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1a/Balloon_Imogen_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220905014429)\n\nThe party decides to head to Paragon's Call 's Seat of Disdain . In an effort to disguise herself via a wild magic surge, Imogen manages to cast Levitate on herself so the party pulls her along like a balloon. As they walk, Orym notices the bounty hunter Artana Voe , who was linked to Armand Treshi in Jrusar , passes them without notice in the street. He follows her, and when she enters an alley and stops, greets her. She says she's just in town visiting a friend, and although Orym doesn't believe her, when she walks off he goes back to the group and tells them about it.\n\nThey are admitted to the courtyard of the Seat of Disdain where many Paragon's Call members are hurriedly loading a mammoth- crawler with a large pile of crates and boxes as a dust storm seems to be approaching. General Ratanish greets them and shows them to their quarters. Shortly, a minotaur named Rockmond joins them saying he's to show them around. He takes them to the armory and provides uniform cloaks, then around the upstairs. When Imogen asks if any areas are off limits, he tells them they should have no reason to go to the basement. For today, they should just not be too curious unless they're asked to do something. The mammoth-crawler is being loaded today and hopes to leave tomorrow, dust storm permitting. Usually these shipments take about a week to deliver and return, using the Call's best soldiers. Rockmond then escorts them back down to the courtyard.\n\nThey watch the loading continue as the dust storm approaches. Ashton grabs a crate and pitches in, and although Ratanish warns them about taking initiative (except in defense of the Call) without orders, he approves and they all start helping. Inside are for the most part all manner of construction materials. About four of the crates they load are labeled \"Treshi\", are locked, and seem to hold glassware. They are a similar size to the crate Ashton remembers opening at Jiana Hexum 's home that held vials of magical grey liquid. [1] There are also two black metal, surprisingly light but heavily locked, reinforced chests, about a foot-and-a-half square with slightly rounded edges on the top. Faintly engraved in their tops is the symbol of the Cerberus Assembly . When everything is loaded, Ratanish thanks them and tells them to wait out the storm inside.\n\nThey head to their quarters and talk about what to do. They aren't sure if Treshi plans to leave tomorrow with the crates bearing his name, but FCG suggests maybe they should forget Treshi for now and follow the crates. The idea of using the ring that tracked Treshi to now track the crawler is raised, until they remember they left it at the pawn shop. FCG asks Chetney to craft a brooch, and he reluctantly does so. They give it to Fearne , hoping she could use it to distract Ratanish (whose hobby is jewelry-making).  FCG then casts Locate Creature and they learn Treshi is directly beneath them, presumably in the basement. Chetney proposes scouting it with his Invisibility and Fearne gives him the portable hole just in case he finds Treshi.\n\n![Laudna and Ashton - Cha Cha Rae](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nLaudna decides to go get the tracking ring and Ashton goes with her into the raging dust storm. They make their way to the Bank of Renewal pawn shop run by the Hiro family, who admit them when they say they're seeking shelter from the storm. After a lot of small talk, Ashton buys the ring. On the way back, Ashton tells Laudna he thinks she's hiding a bunch of bad shit, but she responds that he knows about as much as she does. Her past trauma is still with her. Ashton has come to terms with being broken, but thinks Imogen and FCG can still fix themselves, and Laudna suggests they can give them the life she and Ashton never had. Ashton worries about her, and suggests she communicate with everyone more. Her bullshit is adorable, but not all the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the invisible Chetney sneaks toward the basement, entry to which is closed off by a barred grate which he successfully lockpicks. Dodging guards, he finds a large room with six prison cells. One of the larger cells holds furniture resembling a guest room and Armand Treshi is inside, reading. Chetney moves toward a massive iron vault door at other end of the hallway, but discovers it, too, is guarded, with a possible pull for an alarm bell. Stymied, Chetney retreats back upstairs.\n\nThe party regathers in their quarters where Chetney reports what he found and they try to figure out what to do. Ashton shares that the crates marked with Treshi's name didn't contain his belongings; they were the same as the ones in Jiana Hexum's house. Laudna suggests they reach out to her to ask what was in the crates, and Chetney agrees, but Ashton is very reluctant. They decide to plant the tracking ring on the caravan and see what develops.\n\nAt that moment, they hear shouting: \"Up front now, arms!\" The other Call members around them are donning armor, grabbing weapons, and charging into the courtyard. There are fiery explosions near the loaded mammoth-crawler, and cries to \"Defend the load!\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e32-a_stage_set"}

Convincing him to come along with you as his best interests, you tossed him into your portable hole and ran into Artana Voe , another bounty hunter. After making an odd alliance with her, you began to escape the compound, noticing that it was under siege by what seemed to be Artana or at least a group that was likely in cahoots with her. In the midst of this chaos, some of you were running interference in the middle of the courtyard. Other ones were trying to whisk Armand out. You all began to reconvene, but not before coming face-to-face with Otohan Thull , once, while our good friend Laudna was climbing the side of the fortress, and the secondary time as you attempted to escape in two separate groups at the exterior of the perimeter wall in the middle of a raging sandstorm that had just begun to calm.\n\n![Laudna's death - Northyme](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/60/Laudna%27s_death_-_Northyme.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20220918123149)\n\nOtohan squared off with you, the skirmisher that one half of your group had been using to escape had been sliced through, exploded, and left your party sundered and separated. After a brief discussion, combat ensued, and throughout this combat, one by one some of you began to fall, Otohan gleefully carving the life from members of Bells Hells, eyes focused and trained on Imogen and asking for her to give into her nature. With each death, the pulse within her began to grow stronger and stronger in the back of Imogen's mind.\n\nFearne and Orym both lie slain in the center street here of the sandstorm-smothered Bassuras , Laudna on death's door, when that impulse, driven by trauma, anger, and whatever strange force lies within her pushing Imogen over the edge. And in doing so, screaming, that latent power and energy swelling within her, overtaking her body, and where once a sandstorm once stood, instead, bursts of red energy and light began to swirl around. The surrounding structures began to carve away, the secondary internal storm beginning to and destroy within the proximity. With a final scream, everything goes white.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAs Imogen's psychic pulse hits them, each of the living party members experience a flood of silent memories. Fresh Cut Grass remembers his life with Dancer and then Bells Hells before older memories break through of a beautiful flying city filled with celebrating aeormatons , then a shouting, angry man he fears. A green path and a kind older noblewoman whom FCG likes, and tries to help. \"She smiles. She frowns. She is gone.\"\n\nChetney remembers several youthful romances and the satisfaction of his work, but within him, a hunger stirs. As he looks up to the full glowing red moon Ruidus , a single beam of pure crimson light envelops him and he gives into the beast, feeling an uncontrollable impulse to hunt and kill.\n\nAshton 's memories are of their early childhood, surrounded by rushing people and their parents, the fear within them growing. Their mother touches their shoulder and kisses their head, pointing ahead as many people take their places around a vibrant, glowing gateway. Their mother hands their father a leather mask and headdress, which he puts on, saying, \"It begins.\"\n\nLaudna remembers the Parchwood around her family home, then the luxurious dinner with a dark Lord and Lady . The dread that filled her then remains still, as Delilah remains always with her, and Laudna fears she may lose herself to her. Delilah's voice comes: \"I am of his blood. I will endure. My will is unrelenting. You are my vessel in life, unlife, and beyond. I will endure!\"\n\nImogen remembers her early childhood, being comforted by her mother after a fall. Liliana suddenly looks concerned, looking away into the distance. Imogen opens her eyes to see Otohan Thull staring back at her, her body crackling with energy, saying, \"You are a true predator. A gift in their image. If you can be as strong as we can, to deny your nature is to be consumed by it. To embrace it is to master your own fate. I am proud of you.\" The voice of Liliana echoes in Imogen's mind: \"Run, Imogen. Run!\"\n\nImogen attempts to run as Otohan continues to follow and entreat her to join them. Finally, Imogen turns and blasts Otohan, sending her streaking away into the white, and she hears the sound of multitudes of bricks hitting the ground. When she opens her eyes she is standing again in the streets of Bassuras , but most of the buildings are gone. A moment later, the rest of the party reappears as well, still in place where (and as) they were, but Otohan is gone.\n\nStill in initiative order, Laudna is first, still at two failed death saves. Marisha rolls a natural 1. Seeing memories of the powerful women in her life, Laudna feels the arms of Delilah embrace her from behind, whispering, \"Worry not, child. Death is but a waiting game.\"\n\nNo one sees Laudna's death, but Imogen becomes aware that their psychic link is again broken and finds her in the rubble some distance from the others. Meanwhile, Fresh Cut Grass moves to Fearne and casts Revivify , telling Fearne's spirit he thinks she's making a new family with them, that he wants to help her be whole again, and that he needs her to stay. Sam rolls a 10, exactly meeting the DC. Beyond the dark border of death and oblivion, Fearne thinks about staying to explore but eventually decides to be pulled upward, back out into the light. FCG tells her that Orym is dead and they have less than thirty seconds left to save his life.\n\nAshton dashes over to Imogen and begins helping her get Laudna out from under the rubble. Imogen takes out the gnarlrock shard, and addresses Delilah, telling her, \"I know you're there, you bitch. I know you still want her.\" She places the shard under Laudna's hands crossed over her chest. She and Ashton hear Fearne shout that Orym is dead and Ashton carries Laudna toward them, shouting that there's another one down. Chetney carries Orym toward Ashton.\n\nThis leaves the choice of who to use her only Revivify on completely up to Fearne, who doesn't know who to choose. The rest of the party is at a loss as well, although FCG, Imogen, and Chetney point out that Laudna has been dead before and came back. FCG gives Fearne his medallion of the Changebringer to flip as a coin. As Fearne continues to hesitate, Imogen casts Sending to Delilah: \"You better bring her back. I know you want to be in this world, and she's your only way here. Get your ass down here and bring her back!\" The reply comes: \"Poor thing. I would if I could, but I ask you to bring her back, too, for both of us.\" Fearne tosses the coin.\n\nLooking at the result, she goes to Laudna and kneels at her side, telling her, \"We'll find a way back for you, I promise.\" She then moves to Orym and gathers him up, asking him to please come back because she's getting a little scared. They need his help because they can't do this alone.\n\n![Will and Orym - Toby James Sharp](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/93/Will_and_Orym_-_Toby_James_Sharp.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220917025618)\n\nOrym, meanwhile, is in a place of peace, the cherry blossoms and sweet breezes of Zephrah . He turns to see Will just as he hears Fearne's words, and he sees a shaft of light coming down toward him from above. Will tells him he's not done, and Orym chokes out, \"I really wish I could stay.\" They embrace, and telling him to go, Will throws him up toward the shaft of light. He opens his eyes to see Fearne's anxious face. She tells him Laudna is dead.\n\nOrym wants to know what they should do, because they always do something. As Imogen falls to her knees beside Laudna, Ashton opens the portable hole and jumps in. Armand Treshi is alive, and Ashton demands if he has anything that can fix someone who's died. Treshi does not. Ashton jumps back out, angrily saying they can call in favors and find people. Imogen remains with Laudna, and they hear in their minds, over and over, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!\"\n\nBehind the partially crumbled walls of the Seat of Disdain , they hear shouts and rallying cries from Paragon's Call . Ashton starts to put Laudna in the hole, but Imogen demands they carry her. The gnarlrock tumbles to the ground and Imogen retrieves it, as the party hurries off through the streets toward Imahara Joe 's for sanctuary and a place to talk in safety.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nAs they walk, FCG asks Fearne for his Changebringer coin back but she refuses. They succeed in avoiding attention arising from the very large explosion that just occurred and make their way through the streets toward Imahara Joe 's, where they're admitted. Ashton lets Armand Treshi out of the portable hole and ties him up, while FCG apologizes to Joe for possibly bringing danger to him by their presence. Joe is taken aback by Laudna 's corpse and asks exactly what kind of danger he is now in. They explain that Paragon's Call doesn't like them very much right now.\n\nChetney threatens Treshi with having a finger bitten off it he doesn't start answering their questions, but Joe intervenes. He is very worried by the idea of Paragon's Call following them to his shop, and opens a hidden trap door leading to a small storage space where he tells them to hide.\n\nTreshi tells the group he had nothing to do with the Shade Mother - that was Ira Wendagoth 's doing. The Call had hired Ira to create chaos to push the Chandei Quorum to hire Paragon's Call, but Ira was overzealous and went too far. It was he who got Treshi involved with the Shade Mother and Emoth Kade . While Treshi claims not to know why Otohan Thull wanted to move into Jrusar with the Call, Fearne believes he knows more than he's saying. Ashton and Chetney threaten him, but Orym just stabs him through the foot and Imogen pushes him back in the hole. Treshi cracks, saying he thought it was an opportunity to rise in the power structure of Jrusar and within his house , but he now believes the deal was more about the shipments from Wildemount than politics. Treshi has a shipment line that crosses the Ozmit Sea into the Menagerie Coast . Multiple shipments in the past year have come through, funneling through Jiana Hexum in Jrusar before being brought to Bassuras where the Call moved them to another site. Treshi assumed that Artana Voe was there to collect him because there was a bounty on his head in Jrusar.\n\nChetney lockpicks a door leading out of the storage area and discovers a tunnel apparently leading to the caverns through which the Deathwish Run ran. Ashton brings out the crate, box, and vials stolen from the Call. The vials are the same as the ones in Otohan Thull's back device which apparently powered her use of the echo knights in the battle. FCG Identifies them as each containing a Potion of Possibility , and realizes the magic they contain is something he's never encountered before.\n\nThey talk about where they might find help for Laudna. Chetney suggests Ajit Dayal ; Ashton suggests Jiana Hexum; Fearne suggests Morri Calloway ; Orym suggests either Vex'ahlia and Percival de Rolo , or Keyleth . They agree Keyleth is a good suggestion, but her coming to Bassuras would be dangerous. Their first priority needs to be getting out of the city, and alerting Lord Eshteross to the danger he is in.\n\nChetney discovers the Cerberus Assembly -marked box is trapped and would be triggered by contact with metal. While they take a short rest, he crafts some mahogany lockpicks, then takes the box into the tunnel where he opens it and discovers a six-inch cube of residuum powder. The party commissions a lead box from Joe (for an eye-popping 300 GP) and Chetney disposes of the empty box down the tunnel. He then lockpicks the crate and discovers six more Potions of Possibility for a total of eight, and they each take one.\n\n![Orym comforting Imogen - Jenny Dolfen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAshton wraps Laudna's body in several Paragon's Call cloaks so she'll be easier to carry and they settle down for a long rest. Midway through, Chetney hears someone enter above and heavy footfalls. It is searchers from the Call looking for the party. Chetney quickly wakes everyone and they move into the tunnel, closing the door behind them. The searchers find the storage area, but do not investigate the door, and leave. Joe raises the price of the box to 400 GP.\n\nAfter completing a long rest, FCG apologizes to Chetney for attacking him when Chetney hit him. [1] As an apology, he gives him a wooden toolbox. Fearne asks Imogen what that psychic blast was, but Imogen doesn't know. She shares her vision with the party, and the others do as well. Ashton shows them the ceremonial leather helmet they stole from the Twilight Mirror Museum [2] but all they know is that it was used in some form of Hishari ritual in which they were a central part and their parents were both present, which the Ashari considered to be a reckless toying with elements not fully understood. It was the last day Ashton saw their parents. They only vaguely remember seeing a cataclysm of elemental force ripping everything apart, and woke up wandering the deadlands outside the city, when they were placed in the Greymoore Home.\n\n![Gentle Repose - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen Sends to Captain Xandis and learns that the skyship is only a half day away. She also notices the lightning marks on her arms are about an inch and a half longer than before, reaching just above her elbows. She still feels terrible about everything that happened. FCG casts Gentle Repose on Laudna, getting a sense that the spell \"definitely headed something off at the pass\". Imogen then Sends to Lord Eshteross , telling him that they have Armand, but lost Laudna, and asking if he knows someone powerful enough to bring her back. Eshteross is sympathetic but not encouraging. FCG follows up with a warning that Otohan knows he sent them, and might come for him. Eshteross promises to see if he has any contacts that can aid Laudna, and tells them to bring her there.\n\nChetney gives FCG a mood indicator dial since FCG's face can't move to display emotions. It's now early morning, and they pay Joe, pick up their lead box and place the residuum inside it. Joe promises to try to find out about \" D \", the mysterious metal-masked figure who brought FCG to town. Ashton asks him, if he sees Zeeland, Bennet, or Shady Sally , to tell them Ashton's looking for them.\n\nThey reach the edge of the city, pass the carmine wall and enter the Outer Skids, where they see their skyship approaching. They also notice three crawlers start to head out to meet it as the residents of the city curiously come out to see it. The ship drops rope ladders, the party grabs them, and they all climb aboard with an assist for Chetney from Imogen's Fly spell. To the sound of rifle fire from the pursuing crawlers, the ship takes off northward toward Jrusar.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e34-what_dreams_may_come"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E33-Blood and Dust","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after learning about some odd, kooky things surrounding the moon Ruidus , had an odd vision of something structural and massive on one part of the surface of the red moon as well as elements of Fearne 's history that seems to tether her to being born beneath this same red moon many, many years ago.\n\nAfter learning some of this information and watching Ira Wendagoth vanish into the ether for whatever he has planned and plotted, you returned to Bassuras , being dropped off by Birdie Calloway who returned to the hideaway, and began to figure out how best to handle the day before you look into Treshi . You went to Imahara Joe 's place to inspect what may have caused this strange bit of violence that came from FCG . Couldn't quite pinpoint any reasoning for it. Learned a bit about the physiology of this Aeormaton that you've had with you, as well as a bit of possible history that may have a connection. Then went over to check out the Seat of Disdain where the crawler faction with the city, Paragon's Call , that seems to be highly involved in both the business of this fugitive Treshi, as well as some of the things going on around Otohan , the Paragon's Call group leader and an individual that they've been seen with many years ago, and a lot of the business in Jrusar as well. You passed by Artana Voe , who you met once before, a bounty hunter in Jrusar who seems to have made a trek out here around the same time.\n\nYou went and introduced yourself as new members of Paragon's Call after proving yourselves in the Deathwish Run . They brought you in, showed you your quarters and your barracks, gave you a tour of the place, but while keeping a close eye on you as you did so. About the time this happened, the distant darkened dust and sandstorm that was slowly encroaching began to overtake the town as everyone battened down the hatches and sought to wait it out. During this time, you found that Treshi was indeed being kept in the Seat of Disdain in the basement, the locked away basement, within a cell, a prison cell that had been outfitted to be almost like a guest quarters but still definitely a cell.\n\nAfter Chetney had done a search and information gathering mission, and a few of you also went and gathered the ring that you could track with from the local jeweler in the middle of the storm, you began to figure out how to handle this possible capture of Treshi when you began to hear commotion and shouts and yells. As you went and followed them out to the front, the doors to the Seat of Disdain were open, the sandstorm blasting by as you heard people shouting, yelling, and explosions and fiery impacts as one member of the Call hits the ground in front of you, covered in burns.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nOnce in the courtyard, Bells Hells can see the loaded mammoth- crawler is being attacked by a group of unknown assailants coming over the walls. They quickly decide to utilize the confusion and split up: Laudna , Fearne , and Ashton will try to plant the ring on the crawler in the confusion, while Chetney , Imogen , and Orym retrieve Armand Treshi from the basement cell. Fresh Cut Grass stays outside, trying to see who's attacking.\n\n![Laudna exploring the crawler - Jason deBit](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f4/Laudna_exploring_the_crawler_-_Jason_deBit.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220912012547)\n\nIn the chaos outside, Laudna Spider Climbs up the crawler's leg and into the cargo compartment while Ashton and Fearne move to \"help\" the Paragon's Call members with crates which have fallen from the crawler to the ground. Fearne manages to grab one of the small square black ones. Another crate has shattered revealing dozen of crystal vials holding gray liquid, and Ashton manages to steal three of them. A larger explosion rocks the crawler, sending it listing to the side.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Treshi heads to the basement, noticing that the door Chetney locked behind himself is now unlocked. As Chetney leads the way down the stairs, he falls over a tripwire but isn't seriously hurt. There is, however, an unconscious guard at the bottom. As they move forward, two other guards begin firing in their direction, but the party quickly realizes that the guards are aiming at other assailants, out of sight. Treshi is still in his cell, pressed against a wall, terrified and trying to stay out of sight. As Orym parcours into the battle area, he finds himself at the wrong end of Artana Voe 's blade, but she turns to shoot and takes out one of the remaining guards. Imogen casts Psychic Lance incapacitating her, then reaches through the bars of Treshi's cell, flips out the portable hole , and tells Treshi to jump in it. Artana tells Orym, \"Whatever you think you're doing here, you're fucking up a lot,\" but Orym convinces her to come with them. Chetney intimidates Treshi into jumping into the hole. Artana disappears, asking Orym where they propose to take Treshi, and Orym tells her \"home\". She answers, \"Maybe our paths aren't quite as different as you think.\"\n\nMeanwhile, outside, the party is taking damage from stray explosions and flying debris. FCG manages to get a damaged skirmish-crawler turned right-side-up and running. Ashton jumps in and urges them to move to the gate. Laudna climbs up the building, unexpectedly coming face-to-face with Otohan Thull who is looking down on the chaos, and Laudna immediately casts Darkness . She uses the confusion to clumsily tuck the tracking ring under Otohan's cloak and her mirrors absorb Otohan's attack. Laudna flings herself off the building, and Feather Falls to the ground where she and Fearne meet up.\n\nDownstairs, Artana is leading the way out when they are accosted by two more guards. Telling Artana telepathically to play along, Imogen tackles her and tells the guards they have this handled. On their way back outside, they encounter Ratanish and Imogen pushes Artana toward him. Artana manages to pull free and vanishes again.\n\n![Otohan in the dust storm - Cha Cha Rae](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOutside, the group has moved on their crawler near the rear gate away from the bulk of the battle. Ashton's \"Space\" rage allows him to open a portal near the top brace barring the gate to lift and remove it. Fearne then uses her Stonky's Ring to remove the remaining braces. They are joined by the rest of the party, but they all won't fit on the crawler, so they decide to split up and meet at Imahara Joe 's. FCG, Orym, Laudna, Imogen, and Fearne take the crawler, but as they turn into the main thoroughfare, there is a shape seen through the sandstorm, waiting for them -- Otohan Thull.\n\nOtohan attacks the crawler, destroying its front wheel and throwing everyone in it to the ground when it explodes. As the rest of the party arrives as well, Otohan says, \"Let's have a conversation, shall we?\" Three dark, shadowy versions of Otohan appear around her.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nWhile Otohan admires the brashness of the party, she asks who their employer is while moving closer to Imogen . Orym steps in front of Imogen, then recognizes that he has seen Otohan's shadow assassins before. [2] Imogen casts Hungry Torrent which destroys the three echoes, but Orym feels Otohan invade his mind, demanding again who they work for and seeming amused when she learns it is Lord Eshteross . When Imogen lies that they know nothing about Otohan, FCG tries to help by invoking their Trusted Companion status to give her a Bonded Blessing. However, he appears to experience pain and the pain seems to happen every time thereafter that he uses a spell to aid another party member. Otohan doesn't believe Imogen and continues to take damage by remaining within the spell radius, but uses a legendary resistance to halve the damage. She casually re-summons her echoes.\n\nAs combat begins, Otohan attacks Ashton with three weapon attacks and an offhand strike by one of the echoes, doing 65 points of damage and knocking him unconscious. Orym immediately feeds him a potion of healing before his own attack, bringing him back up. Otohan uses a legendary action to attack Imogen and knocks her prone, but Chetney responds with his Blood Curse of Bloated Agony and Imogen Misty Steps away to a nearby building. As the battle continues, Otohan uses her legendary actions to inflict serious damage on multiple party members each round while using her Psi-Powered Leap to move around easily, convincing the party they need to run rather than stand and fight.\n\nOtohan uses another legendary resistance to avoid Fearne 's Hold Person , and Fearne, Laudna , and FCG begin moving away. Otohan attacks Orym, however, knocking him prone and then unconscious. Sensing Imogen's mind, Otohan looks toward her but moved toward Fearne, casually slashing Ashton as she moves past him and knocking him out again, then using a legendary action to knock out Fearne as well. Laudna uses Wither and Bloom to bring Ashton back while FCG casts Healing Word on Fearne, but Otohan immediately Psychic Leaps to Laudna and knocks her out as well, and her attempt to use Strength of the Grave to remain conscious fails. Otohan immediately uses her final attack to inflict two failed death saves on Laudna.\n\nImogen realizes her psychic link with Laudna is down. She steps out of hiding, casts Fly on herself and goes straight up 60 feet, telepathically calling to Otohan, \"Enough! Let's end this.\" Fearne casts Cure Wounds on Orym through Mister, and Marisha rolls a natural 20 on her death save for Laudna, bringing her conscious with one hit point as she hears a slow heartbeat and Delilah Briarwood 's voice saying, \"Not yet, my child. We have much to do.\" As she comes to consciousness, she chokes out, \"Imogen.\" For the first time since combat started, all of Bells Hells are conscious.\n\n![Orym's death - Lyadrielle](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOtohan turns to Imogen, saying, \"Your friends are extremely, obnoxiously resilient. Perhaps I've been going about this the wrong way. I should be more complete with my job.\" She viciously attacks Chetney before changing places with an echo to stab Orym, still prone, knocking him unconscious. As he goes down, his hand releases the blue sending stone connected with Dorian 's that he was reaching for. Otohan stabs twice more, saying just before the killing blow, \"We've met before.\" Orym is dead. Otohan looks up at Imogen.\n\n![Fearne's goodbye - Lyadrielle](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOtohan then uses a legendary action to attack Fearne, knocking her unconscious while saying, \"You carry the seed. Just not as strong as others.\" Crying, Imogen flies toward Otohan, screaming for her to leave her friends alone. Her successful Dissonant Whispers seems to actually please Otohan. Laudna Messages Otohan, saying they know where Ira Wendagoth and the Moontide Crown are. Otohan is interested, immediately asking Imogen if it's true and psychically invading her mind to learn that it is, at least partially. Holding her blade above the unconscious Fearne, she demands the information now or she will strike. Laudna tells her east, in the Panagrip Sands . Looking at Imogen, Otohan says, \"You were so close,\" as she stabs twice into Fearne. Fearne's final words are, \"Boy, that was a hell of a run.\"\n\nOtohan then turns on Chetney, knocking him unconscious with two failed death saves. Turning to Imogen again, she says, \"The more you run from it, the more you lose. There is greatness in you, and our fight is soon. Embrace it, or become like the rest.\" Imogen feels churning storm energy within her, calling to her as she fights it. Otohan urges her to surrender to her nature. Imogen approaches, hand out, and Witch Bolts her, but Otohan invades her mind again, urging her to give into the sensation calling more and more strongly to her.\n\n![Otohan stabbing Laudna - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen flies down to Otohan, demanding she let the others go, but Otohan responds, \"You give in, or you all die. We only need the strongest of us.\" Laudna uses Wither and Bloom on Chetney and Otohan, bringing Chetney to consciousness, but Otohan notices, asking Imogen, \"Is she your favorite?\" Imogen frantically says, \"I'll go with you! I give in. Don't hurt her.\" The response is, \"You don't just choose to give in or let go when the moment's right.\" She moves to Laudna and attacks, sending her unconscious and inflicting two failed death saves. Holding the body aloft on her sword, she looks at Imogen.\n\nThe call within Imogen is screaming to her to give in. As Otohan prepares to stab Laudna again, Imogen hopelessly casts Dissonant Whispers once more. She then fails a Wisdom saving throw and feels the storm rise up within her.\n\n“As that burning storm within you burns up from within, you feel a tidal surge pulling you under, like the dark abyss of the ocean swallowing you up, but it's nothing but red, warm, crackling fury. As it does, the entire landscape around you turns red, the dust storm, the wind freezes, the sand frozen in the air. The coloration of this entire region of the city turns a deep, deep red. Otohan looks back at you. \"Yes! Yes! This is it!\" The rest of you, looking at Imogen, her hair fully extended and levitating, her skin a deep crimson hue. The thin bolts that had stretched up parts of her are now alight and glowing, and now encompass whole facets of her body. As she stands there lifting, the very space around her shakes and adjusts. And as you scream one more time, uncontrollably, all that pain, all that fury, all that vengeance within, as you unleash it, you watch as all the buildings tear away, the bricks crackling around like a whirlwind. The rest of you are pulled throughout and with one final scream: White.” \n–  The final moments of the episode.\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e33-blood_and_dust"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E31-Breaking Point","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , in their search for Armand Treshi , encountered some interesting intrigue, encountered some betrayal, and eventually met up with the parents of Fearne Calloway , who themselves seem to have been caught up in this strange Ruidus business that you're beginning to unfurl at an escalating pace, discovering apparently that Fearne herself was a Ruidusborn . In the attempts to protect their child, they got involved a bit deeper than they intended to, before escaping into Exandria for a number of years. There have been some discussions about this disparity in the experience between the years that you were in the Feywild , wondering what they were up to, and the years that they experienced and passed here.\n\nBut traveling alongside Birdie across the desert lands of the Hellcatch , a brief encounter with some brigands from the Fist of the Ruiner and destroying them entirely, gathering some goods, some well-earned spoils from the battle, you headed off to the hideaway where the Calloways have been working with their ally, Ira Wendagoth , the Nightmare King. There, they have been constructing over time an apparatus that seemed to be constructed with the hopes of unveiling the nature of Ruidus, to give them some inclination as to what exactly is going on with this moon, as many different threads in the world seem to be converging towards this point in time in the specific astral entity.\n\nUpon arriving and meeting Ollie, your father, and having a reunion with Ira, some questions back and forth seemed to cause some tensions, some reveals of history and timelines and intent led to some relatively heated conversation. But upon the Weave Lens that you were given by Morrigan as you left the Feywild being delivered to your parents and thus on to Ira, who installed it, the final piece of this machine, this scope that he had created, allowed it to engage. He showed a number of you sights you had not seen before, glimpses through a scope that could both read what appeared to be the larger magical leylines that slowly encompass and seem to be, in some way, drifting across the lands of Exandria. You got to look past the daylight into the stratosphere and beyond to get a glance at Ruidus cleanly, clearly, and where the texture of storms seemed to still swirl there upon its surface, you, Orym , and then passing on the honed vision to Imogen , you saw a flash of something that you swear looked like a city on the surface.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nIra demands to know what Orym and Imogen saw through the scope , but Imogen tells him they saw only the arcane cage around Ruidus . Ira immediately looks through the apparatus himself and begins chuckling. Fresh Cut Grass casts Detect Thoughts on him, reading curiosity and excitement, but when they try to push in further, they read nothing before a vision of Ira's face intrudes, inflicting psychic damage and bringing them close to unconsciousness.\n\nAfter apparently having cast a Wall of Force around himself, Ira thanks everyone for helping bring his project to fruition, then rapidly scans with the scope, saying he wants to \"watch their faces as they fail.\" When questioned, he admits he helped build the machine in the Feywild along with the Unseelie Court and their allies Otohan Thull and an older gentleman named Ludinus . They were close to finishing when the Calloways stole the Moontide Crown . Since the Court is now chasing the Calloways, Ira can't associate with them further. He pulls the Crown from the scope and places it on his head, bows, and disappears in a flash of purple energy.\n\n![Imogen and Orym - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/cf/Imogen_and_Orym_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220822131623)\n\nHondir identifies the arcane energy weave around Ruidus as similar to that of the Divine Gate while Orym recovers the now-inactive Weave Lens from the scope. Ashton immediately takes it and hits it with his hammer, thinking if it's magic it can't be harmed, but he's wrong - it shatters. Laudna Mends it but they are unsure if the enchantment remains. Birdie breaks into Ira's desk and they recover a pouch full of gems, a map of the Hellcatch Valley with written notes on it, and a pile of blank paper.\n\nThey discuss what to do next. FCG suggests Dancer could help them analyze the scope, while Laudna suggests telling Paragon's Call about it. Hondir says this information needs to get back to Yios (a week away on foot) as soon as possible, but Hondir himself intends to stay at the hideout indefinitely to stay out of sight.\n\nBirdie again apologizes for leaving Fearne , reiterating they were only trying to keep her safe. Ashton is insistent the Calloways' memories have been altered and Ollie immediately agrees to let Imogen and FCG into his mind. They discover there are indeed areas of his memories of Ira that are blurred or missing. They try to force exploration of a partial piece of memory of Birdie crying, and see both Calloways angrily intent on leaving somewhere. Ollie begins to bleed from one nostril and they pull back.\n\nRemembering they need to report back to Paragon's Call within a few days, they decide to search everything. Dates scratched into the rock show the movement of Ruidus over time as it nears apex at the coming apogee solstice . There is also the single Sylvan word \"curiosity\" on one stone toward the east-northeast direction.\n\nImogen pulls Fearne aside and tells her it's okay to be angry at her parents, and FCG joins in. They encourage her to verbalize her feelings about her parents to them. Chetney provides a wooden doll for Fearne to speak to. FCG realizes he should be talking to Dancer about his own feelings of abandonment, and Imogen realizes she feels the same about her own mother. Fearne pulls her parents aside and tells them how angry she is that she was left with Morri for so long. They acknowledge her feelings and she tells them about her \"child\", Little Mister . Fearne says she'll work at forgiving them and wants to know them better.\n\nLaudna names Fearne's doll \"Caviar\" and they introduce it to Pâté . The two hit it off immediately and arrange for a threesome with Sashimi . Laudna sets up the dollhouse, shoves all three dolls within, and hangs a scrap of fabric over the door.\n\nOrym takes Imogen outside and tells her they need to get to Yios soon. He encourages her, saying she's a born leader and offers to be a sounding board for her. She admits she's torn about contacting Otohan Thull and he tells her to trust herself. He also asks her to cast Sending to Keyleth with a message he has written down: \"Tempest: Following threads. Dark fey influences. Members of the Cerberus Assembly . Power players in Marquet . One month out from trouble. Stay the course? Missing home.\" Keyleth replies: \"I thank you for the message, whoever you are. This is disconcerting news. Stay the course carefully. I'll pull threads on my end. Stay safe.\"\n\nAshton pulls out the strangely familiar Hishari helmet from the Twilight Mirror Museum [1] [2] and goes to sleep staring at it. Orym checks in via sending stone with Dorian , telling him he misses him, and Dorian responds that he's keeping busy and misses them all, too.\n\nFCG goes outside and casts Sending to Dancer , saying: \"Dancer, Fresh Cut Grass reporting in. Awaiting designation and assignment. What is your current status?\" After a long pause, the reply is: \"How'd you find me? What do you want from me?\"\n\nWhen she thinks everyone is asleep, Fearne stealthily cuts down two of the purple gnarlrock shards in the first room, observed by Orym. She places one in Laudna's dollhouse with the dolls, and the other in Imogen's pouch, telling the watching FCG she's just returning something Imogen lost. Orym also watches her do this, but says nothing.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Laudna and Delilah - @cpprcoyote](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/46/Laudna_and_Delilah_-_%40cpprcoyote.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220822204343)\n\nIn the morning, Laudna looks inside the dollhouse and finds the gnarlrock shard. She tries to show it to Imogen but as she reaches for it, the approving voice of Delilah Briarwood creeps into her mind. Laudna pulls back and Imogen picks it up with her handkerchief and throws it across the room, shattering it. However, Delilah's voice returns, saying to Laudna, \"You wander dangerous paths. Be warned, child. Not everyone's looking out for your wellbeing like I am. I'll keep you safe.\" Laudna goes outside and demands more information, and Delilah tells her she is watching from her \"distant, forgotten perch\" as Laudna wanders around dangerous magics. Laudna knows the impact they could have on her, and Delilah is just trying to keep her safe. \"For if you die, I go, too.\" Laudna asks about Ruidus and Delilah admits she's researched the power of the celestial solstices . She herself had to cast a ritual before its optimum time and still achieved something great. [3] She encourages Laudna to get as involved as she'd like. Surreptitiously, Orym tells Imogen that Fearne also put a shard in Imogen's backpack.\n\nFresh Cut Grass Sends to Dancer again, saying they might need her soon and asking where she is. Dancer's terrified voice responds, \"Please, leave me alone. I barely got away. I hope I never see you again. You know what you did.\" FCG's mind fills with static and they take four stress points, going silent and limp. Imogen tries Detect Thoughts , but reads only stress and anger coming from a cacophony of hundreds of voices and thoughts built up through years. When she tries pushing further, she is repulsed and pulls back. Chetney tries to reset FCG by hitting them on the head, but FCG immediately attacks with their buzzsaw and casts Spiritual Weapon in the form of a chisel, shouting, \"Why don't you shut up? Why don't you shut your fucking mouth?\" Roll initiative!\n\n![Fresh Cut Grass - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1a/Fresh_Cut_Grass_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20220822120604)\n\nAshton grapples FCG, trying to keep them from doing more damage. Laudna, however, interpreting Delilah's message as, \"Your friends are going to betray you,\" casts Hunger of the Shadow . She crits for 50 damage and for a moment feels warmth and life in her heart. When Fearne follows up with Heat Metal , FCG goes unconscious, shouting hurtful words at Fearne and Laudna that reflect their deepest fears and insecurities. Orym removes FCG's buzzsaw arm and strings them upside down by a rope hanging from the ceiling. Fearne heals them to consciousness.\n\nFCG remembers nothing and is woozy and surprised to find himself hanging upside down, but he feels great and is his normal cheerful self. He heals Chetney, but is speechless when his actions are described to him. The group realizes that the horrific scene Ashton encountered when they first found FCG could indeed have been created by him. Imogen brings up the one-eyed creature FCG remembers, but Ashton realizes one of FCG's ocular units was damaged when Ashton found him and had to be replaced.\n\n![FCG - cvleart](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen looks into FCG's mind (who does not resist), looking for the reasons behind the hurtful comments, discovering that the memory of the past few minutes has somehow been edited out. The voices she heard earlier in their mind were memories of things they've heard, folded into one moment. She hears Chetney say, \"I love working with wood. [4] I didn't feel I needed anyone,\" herself say, \"I have this thing with crowds,\" [5] Fearne say, \"I have so many regrets,\" [6] and Orym say, \"Most nights I miss him, but the time we had was real good.\" [7] Laudna says, \"Andy,\" [8] and Ashton says, \"'Friends' is a complicated word; I try to avoid it.\" [9]\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna has backed slowly into a corner. Ashton points out that any of them except Orym could snap at any moment; it's happened before. Chetney protests it was one bite. [10] Laudna Mends the dents in FCG's head that her spell created, and she is obviously shaken by the damage she caused. The party believes they need to talk to Dancer, but without FCG. Ashton admits that Ashton thinks FCG might indeed have caused the bloody deaths of their prior adventuring party. Both Ashton and Orym ask the entire party to commit to be better together by reining in any member that falls out of line.\n\nThey all agree that talking to Dancer and hopefully bringing her to inspect the broken scope is now a must. Orym lowers the still-hanging FCG, who immediately removes their bolt-thrower and grapple cannon and hands them to Orym, but Orym returns the weapons. He reiterates they will do what they have to do to protect themselves if it happens again, and they all pledge to work together to try to protect FCG from that happening.\n\nBirdie will return to Bassuras with them, while Ollie and Hondir stay at the hideout. As they leave, Imogen tells Laudna she knows that Delilah was talking to her earlier, and Laudna says Delilah wanted the other rock, the one that Sashimi gave birth to, and told her that they would all betray her. Imogen reassures her that Delilah is evil, and that Laudna was indeed alive and had a life. She promises they will get through this, and get Delilah out of Laudna's head.\n\nThe group gathers on their two skirmish- crawlers and tear off into the early morning toward Bassuras .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e31-breaking_point"}

Upon triggering a series of memories, some locked, some unseen, you all returned and found Laudna now expired. You managed to recover Fearne and Orym , but Laudna remained dead and beyond your abilities.\n\nYou called the airship to bring you back to Jrusar where you turned in Armand Treshi for quite a bounty. You traded information with Lord Eshteross and prepared for what coming dangers might come to anyone involved in this circumstance. You also reached out to your champion, Keyleth , the Voice of the Tempest, back from Zephrah , who has, amongst her own challenging chaos, found a moment to come and aid you, traveling through a tree within the city of Jrusar and guiding you all to a destination of your choosing, being the Tal'Dorein city of Whitestone . As the doorway opens in the trunk of this tree, you look past into this neighborhood. As you all step through, emerging from where you once were across Exandria , to instead, this city in the center of the Parchwood .\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Orym guarding Keyleth - Jenny Dolfen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/9b/Orym_guarding_Keyleth_-_Jenny_Dolfen.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/215?cb=20221011154221)\n\nAs the party and Keyleth step through the tree into Whitestone , they are greeted by several of the Pale Guard , but Keyleth leads them unescorted towards the castle . On the way, Fresh Cut Grass asks if she is a holy person and if the gods are trustworthy, but her response is guarded although she reveals she has met several of the gods. She is able to determine that the blade that killed Laudna did not contain the toxin that prevented the resurrection of Derrig and Will .\n\nWhen they reach the castle, they are met by members of the Whitestone Rifle Corps including Captain Kynan Leore and Keyleth requests an audience with any member of the Chamber of Whitestone present. While Cassandra de Rolo is currently in Lyrengorn , the Lord is in. Keyleth receives a Sending calling her away, so the party quickly fills her in on what they've learned about Ruidus and the danger to those investigating it. However, she has many irons in the fire at present with the coming of the Apogee Solstice . She asks them to prepare a written report, as currently her main focus, with the other Ashari leaders, is a rogue faction in Issylra . FCG quickly asks about the Changebringer and is told she is one of the good gods (although Keyleth hasn't met her), and Orym asks Keyleth to tell his family he misses them.\n\n![Percival and Gwendolyn - Jackie Webber](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/90/Percival_and_Gwendolyn_-_Jackie_Webber.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/279?cb=20221011012037)\n\nThey are admitted to Lord de Rolo's office where Keyleth briefly introduces the party and asks him to treat their requests as coming from Zephrah before taking her leave. Percival greets them formally, then notices his daughter Gwendolyn de Rolo slip into the room and allows her to remain. Orym explains that their fallen comrade, Laudna , is a native of Whitestone that Lord Percival has encountered before. She was brought to a dinner by a woman named Delilah and hung from the tree in the center of town . They are seeking his aid to bring her back, but he is reluctant to interfere with the natural order. Finally, he decides not to decide but refer the choice to the person with the ability to grant their wish. He tasks Kynan to summon Pike Trickfoot to the castle.\n\nChetney admires and asks about the clock tower, and suggests he and the party may be able to help Lord Percival and his friends. However, he succumbs to a coughing fit when Percy explains that he works mostly with metal and mechanisms. Chetney gives Gwendolyn a tiny wooden rocking horse with a wolf's head. Percy then leads the group to the castle's entry hall. There, they are passed by a pair of bickering half-elven teenagers ( Wolfe and Leona de Rolo ) followed by their mother Vex'ahlia de Rolo . Vex'ahlia stops and introduces herself, and Imogen explains they are the group who sent Bertrand Bell 's body to them.\n\nVex'ahlia seems far more welcoming than the sterner Percival as Imogen and Orym explain Laudna's situation, but she heads upstairs to change from her hunting attire. After an uncomfortable but brief wait, Pike appears, jogging, and greets Percy casually. They all introduce themselves, and Pike introduces herself as a baker, to the party's confusion. They explain what they need and Pike pulls out her holy symbol. In the subsequent conversation, it's revealed that Pike, too, has met a god in person, and has the ability to raise the dead, although she's not making any promises. Percival tells Pike that Laudna was on the Sun Tree , which is overheard by the entering Vex'ahlia as well. Vex tells Percy they have to help Laudna, since Vox Machina was the reason Laudna was on the tree in the first place.\n\nPike asks about how long Laudna's been dead, and the party explains a few days, but that's after walking around for decades. Pike gets diamonds from Vex and prepares a ritual to bring life back to Laudna. As she concentrates, nothing happens at first, but then the ground and the sigil around Laudna lights up in vibrant gold. Laudna's body lifts into the air as Pike explains that she can feel her soul, adrift but not yet beyond reach. But there is something else there, holding Laudna back. Pike suddenly pulls back her hand, the light vanishes, and Laudna falls to the ground. In confusion, Pike says, \"Percy? There's two souls bound to this body, and I can't separate them. And one of them is Delilah Briarwood.\"\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nPercival pronounces: \"Then it is done. She is to remain gone.\" The party argues, but he is adamant that they don't understand what they might be releasing and he will have no part in it. Pike tells them that she can't even talk to Laudna because Delilah is in the way. If she finishes the ritual, she doesn't know which one will come back, but at Vex'ahlia 's urging she offers to research possession and spiritual tethering. Percival sternly tells them to tell him if they find \"a way that is satisfactory\", but to do nothing without his approval. Delilah is to stay gone. He leaves the room.\n\nAshton follows him. He angrily confronts Lord de Rolo, saying he's not satisfied with the ending of that conversation. There's a lot of very weird and important shit happening right now and Laudna is an important and necessary part of it. Percival tells him not to lose that anger, but warns him that if they bring Delilah back, he will kill them all to protect his family and his city. He leaves the room. As Ashton goes to leave as well, he angrily punches a statue and hears a growl behind him. Turning, he sees three bears, one of them ancient and half-asleep. Ashton kneels, telling the youngest bear that it must be nice to be able to growl at people and not have to explain yourself. He then hurries to rejoin the others on their way to Pike's house in town.\n\n![Bells Hells, Pike, and Vex - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5e/Bells_Hells%2C_Pike%2C_and_Vex_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20221011000830)\n\nPike's thatched cottage is homey, warm, and welcoming, filled with knickknacks and paintings. As Pike goes upstairs to search for information, Imogen thanks Vex'ahlia for her help. Vex apologizes for Percival's brusqueness, saying he's \"a complicated man\" who carries a lot of trauma from suffering at the hands of Delilah, but Vex is hoping for the best outcome here. Nothing is worse than losing someone close to you.\n\nPike returns with books and scrolls. She has found a possibility: an older ritual that enables a spirit journey to another realm . The party could travel there and separate Laudna and Delilah long enough for Pike to banish Delilah and bring Laudna back, but Pike's not sure where \"there\" is, since Laudna's soul doesn't seem to be where the recently deceased normally are but in a cold, separate place that feels strongly of Delilah. If they do this, their bodies will remain in the Material Plane , but their souls will join Laudna's, connected by a cord joining them to their bodies. If that cord is cut, they will die. While Delilah seems diminished from Vox Machina 's prior encounters with her, she shouldn't be underestimated. Since Pike's not sure if non-magical weapons will work where Laudna is, Vex loans Orym a +1 shortsword.\n\nFresh Cut Grass , however, is convinced he can't go because he doesn't have a spirit, although Imogen points out they need a backup able to cast Sending if she were to be pulled out of the plane. Pike offers to check whether FCG has a soul or not, and the entire party bets that she will find that he does. Fearne holds his hand as Pike touches him. FCG suddenly finds himself surrounded by light and Pike is a burning silver ember with fiery wings. When he looks down at his own body, he sees only semi-translucent light: his soul.\n\nAs Pike begins preparing the ritual, Imogen gives her the gnarlrock shard to research while they're gone. Pike points out to Vex'ahlia the 6600 gold worth of components required and Vex starts out to get them, but FCG mentions the residuum dust they have and Vex is immediately alert. She agrees, however, to put off hearing where they got it until later. She thinks her husband will be very interested.\n\n![Making Pate - Carlie McCoy](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe ritual complete, Pike casts the spell and the party finds themselves in a mysterious fog-filled place built of silvery gold material surrounded by deep shadow. The fog moves as they do and they are surrounded by sourceless faint whispers. The terrain grows more jagged as they press on. The stony spikes rising upward begin to grow branches until they resemble a forest of trees, and the whispers gradually grow louder and form words. Ahead, they see a flame in the window of a small ramshackle hut, and among the whispered words they hear, \"The witch is here!\" Chetney assumes they mean Delilah but when he creeps closer he sees the body of a rat on a table with a flickering black Laudna-shaped flame next to it. The whispers become shouts of \"Burn her!\". The Laudna-shape looks up and disappears as the cabin begins to burn.\n\n![Laudna's hut - Clara](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAt that moment, Orym sees three billowing collections of what looks like black shadowy cloth drift from between the trees and swiftly move toward the cabin. Imogen Witch Bolts two of them, while an invisible Chetney scoops up the dead rat and bird skull from the now-flaming cottage before exiting. Ashton goes into a \"Possibility\" rage (allowing their teammates within ten feet to add a d4 to attack and saving throws) as the creatures attack, creating a freezing cold dome of Tormenting Shadow (which slows and causes necrotic damage to those within it) and utilizing Life Drains to suck health and spirit from their victims and add it to their own. They are resistant to fire damage but take full damage from magical weapons, and Ashton is able to kill one with their hammer.\n\nThe other two, however, continue to attack. Chetney fails a con save against a Life Drain , which not only causes necrotic damage (which is restored to his attacker) but also reduces his maximum hit points by the same amount. Both creatures then sink into the ground and disappear, although Imogen's Witch Bolt stays up and active. The party holds their attacks, waiting for the creatures to reappear. When they do, they attack Imogen and Chetney, and FCG's taking of half the damage inflicted on Chetney results in FCG losing 10 maximum hit points. One of the shadows then disappears again, but Fearne's Ice Knife kills the other. When the remaining shadow finally reappears, Ashton kills it with a hammer blow. Fearne casts Tidal Wave to extinguish the spreading flames from the hut, and when they investigate they find a root-tangled tunnel beneath it.\n\nChetney is badly hurt and Orym has used most of his abilities, but the party decides against a short rest. Chetney scouts ahead down the tunnel, Ashton casts Pass Without Trace on the party, and they stealthily descend. The dark tunnel winds on for a long time and its gravity is very odd. Chetney picks up the scent of wind and a faint hint of green light. He creeps forward as the tunnel opens, looking down into purplish sky, filled with trees or roots. Stepping forward, the gravity flips upright and he finds himself emerging from the ground in another forest-like realm. Ahead, he sees a partially crumbled wall and rooftops, and beyond, a massive leafless tree looming over the shaded city, with a faint bit of green light drifting out like a mist.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e36-a_desperate_call"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E37-From the Boughs","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after a violent incursion with Otohan Thull in the distant city of Bassuras , lost three of your troop, were able to recover two, leaving Laudna dead and gone. But driven with hope and the inability to accept her loss, you took her body back with you to Jrusar to finish up some of the work that had sent you to that city in the first place, returning Armand Treshi to deal with justice based on his actions, uncovering a few more morsels of the mystery as it unravels, and then asking for aid from your leader, the Voice of the Tempest, to possibly figure out something that could be done here.\n\nKeyleth arrives and, while she lacks, at this moment, the resources and ability to do so, instead sends your troop to the city of Whitestone where she thinks you might be able to find that hope. There, you encounter two members of the council, the Chamber of Whitestone , Percival de Rolo as well as Vex'ahlia de Rolo . Some tense moments based on the circumstances that surround Laudna's existence and current death, a divided idea on whether or not this is a good idea sends you all, along with Pike Trickfoot , the divine, blessed figure that is able to, seemingly, restore Laudna to life. However, it is dangerous to do so with these two souls within Laudna's body, both Laudna's and Delilah Briarwood , who has a very bloody history with the people of Whitestone.\n\nPike does believe there is a possibility you can separate this, and conducts a ritual to project your spirits into this dark, shadowy space where Laudna's spirit is currently held between the realms of the gods . As you all begin to explore this shadowy expanse, pushing back the fog, you encounter an echo of a memory of hers, walking through dark forests and finding an old hut, hearing voices of her being chased and people coming to \"burn her down\". You fight some of these spirits and diffuse the flames before they consume the hut entirely, the shadow of Laudna's memory vanishing. You take a moment to breathe and follow a tunnel of roots that follow deep into the ground of this strange realm below. You scout ahead quite a bit while the rest of you take a moment, and then find yourselves emerging from another surface, another stone-formed forest, and then ahead of you, a somewhat cracked and desolate wall and what looks to be a twisted city beyond it where a massive leafless tree in the center looms.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party cautiously emerges from the tunnel into a strange, spectral version of Whitestone . Chetney picks up a strong scent of undeath and necromancy coming from the city in the distance, and they head toward the tree in its center. Everything including the vegetation and buildings seems to actually consist of the underlying stone. It occasionally shifts with a rumble, adjusting to the party's proximity. As they move forward, the rumbling grows louder and suddenly bones shoot outward from the ground blocking the path forward. Ashton notices that the broken bones bleed and smell of marrow. Orym climbs atop them to view the city, noticing buildings shift and grow out of the ground and that, on the central giant tree , there are dozens of ropes hanging down. He stays atop the roofs to direct the party, and when he stabs into a building it also bleeds and stops moving.\n\n![Matilda - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6b/Matilda_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221017213506)\n\nSuddenly they hear a young voice coming from a narrow alley. Imogen opens her mind to it and senses that it's not a fully material entity, but hears a 12- or 13-year-old boy talking to \" Matilda \", asking why she's been following him and saying the other boys are teasing him about it. He asks if Matilda wants to play a game called \"Secret Treasures\" with him, where he'll give her something if she tells him a secret. Imogen approaches and sees he is talking to a flickering shadow like a young girl, with a purple heart glowing in her chest. She psychically contacts the girl, who is hesitant about agreeing, and Imogen urges her not to trust him. While she hesitates, the boy throws dirt at her before they both vanish into the walls.\n\nImogen's psychic connection remains, however, and Laudna/Matilda tells her that she's playing in the barn, which is usually out of town, but not today. Imogen asks if she can see the tree, but Matilda tells her the tree scares her. From the roof, Orym sees an out-of-place, lantern-lit barn in the distance, and they begin running toward it, evading the moving buildings and erupting bones attempting to head them off.\n\nWhen they reach the barn, it is being engulfed by growing vines. Within, there is a small hideaway in the hayloft with drawings, a blanket, small tools, and half-completed rough dolls made from twigs and hay. The doll of a woman has a necklace around it bearing three red gems. It is picked up by a small shadow-shape with a purple light in its chest, looking to be about a three-year-old child. The child responds to Imogen's telepathic contact, explaining that the \"mean woman\" won't let her leave, and later, \"the tree\" won't let her leave. When Chetney looks outside, the vines have completely covered the barn and begin growing inside as well, and Matilda disappears. The party attacks the vines, learning that while fire harms them the fumes produced when they burn can sap the party's hit dice. Chetney throws a stick of dynamite, clearing a path out of the barn, while Fearne takes the dolls and necklace.\n\nImogen telepathically checks in with Laudna/Matilda, but the responding voice is now older and doesn't recognize Imogen's voice. Matilda says she is very busy right now, getting dressed to go to a dinner. Imogen urges her not to go, but the connection is broken and the others tell Imogen they can't change what happened. Fresh Cut Grass Identifies the necklace Fearne took as non-magical but well-made.\n\nThe party approaches a window glowing with lantern-light, seeing a farm home interior holding an older woman, a man, and the flickering Laudna/Matilda shadow, all getting dressed up. Imogen telepathically assures Laudna they're going to help her get home when it starts to get scary. The father figure addresses one of the others as \"Laudna\" rather than \"Matilda\", and the mother also calls her daughter \"Laudna\". When Laudna goes upstairs, the parents turn toward the party with glowing green eyes, and Imogen tells them, \" Delilah , we're coming for you.\" They both jump forward, shattering the glass window, as their bodies elongate into dark grey-green smoke tendrils that wrap around and injure both Imogen and Fearne. The others join the fight against the creatures, which unsuccessfully attempt to enter and control their bodies. They are quickly defeated and dispersed.\n\nThe group decides to try to confront Delilah at the tree rather than continuing to pursue Laudna, and begin moving in that direction. As they go, the moving buildings instead of blocking them seem to provide a straight path there. They heal up a bit and prepare for battle. Chetney and Imogen take their Potions of Possibility , and they all march toward the center of town. As they approach, a flicker of purple sparks across the ground and spirals into a tall, evil, shadowy form. Looking up at the ominous tree, it sighs, saying \"Ah, fond memories.\"\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe spectral purple energy gathers into the shadowy form of Delilah Briarwood . She greets them, saying it's interesting to finally see them face to face. Looking around, Orym finds Laudna 's purple glow within a cage of branches high in the boughs of the corrupted Sun Tree . Fresh Cut Grass tells Delilah that people who hurt others have often themselves been traumatized, and they'll listen to her if there's anything she wants to share. Delilah laughs. She points out that they all want to keep Laudna alive. Chetney offers negotiation on the basis of this shared interest, and Delilah tells him this realm they find themselves in is not a place of her making, although she's influenced it. Imogen suggests Laudna's death has trapped Delilah there as well, but Delilah seems confident she could find other ways if they fail to reach an agreement. Delilah wants to be brought back to life along with Laudna, and can offer them rewards for doing so. Chetney points out they can't bring Laudna back as long as Delilah is cohabiting in her body, but Delilah says they are not cohabiting, they are one being. If they try to tear her away, Laudna's soul will be sundered, and Delilah will find another way out. If they bring them both back, they will both live.\n\n![Imogen - Haven Burley](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a6/Imogen_-_Haven_Burley.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221017211520)\n\nChetney announces he's sold, but wants to speak to Laudna first. With his natural 20 deception roll, Delilah is convinced they will simply leave unless she allows this, and the branches of the tree part, revealing the cage holding the shadowy Laudna while Matt summons a very surprised Marisha to the table. Imogen hesitantly calls to Laudna, who shakily responds. Imogen tries to reassure her they'll get her home, but Laudna says she's been fighting Delilah for over 30 years now. The branches close at Delilah's gesture. Through her teeth, Imogen says, \"Delilah Briarwood, we're going to sunder you,\" and casts Psychic Lance at her.\n\n![Delilah at the Sun Tree - APixelTaurus](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/50/Delilah_at_the_Sun_Tree_-_APixelTaurus.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20221031225800)\n\nAs combat begins, the shadow Delilah is hovering above the ground out of melee reach. Ashton rages (Possibility) and tries to sling Orym into the tree but can't quite do it and Orym sprints the rest of the way. The party can hit Delilah, but she hits back harder with Necrotic Bursts and has lair actions from the Tree, plus legendary actions and resistances. Her Ward of the Corrupt provides a shield emanating from the tree to surround her, and she casts Negative Energy Flood at Imogen, who uses the first of her two fragments of possibility to succeed on the save for half damage. Delilah then Summons Undead to call five skeletons to the battle. Chetney transforms into wolf form and throws his chisel up at the hovering Delilah, placing his Brand of Castigation upon her. FCG uses their Changebringer coin to cast Turn Undead on the skeletons, destroying all but one of them, then takes out the remains of Delilah's magical shield with Spiritual Weapon . Fearne casts Earthbind on Delilah so she can no longer fly. Imogen uses a new  ability to \"Call Ruidus\", causing lightning damage to both herself and Delilah. They notice that when Delilah is injured, the Sun Tree also flickers as if it's being hurt in the same way.\n\nOrym manages to climb into the tree, trying to get to Laudna, but the tree swallows her into its trunk, then uses Hungry Vines to attack all the party except Orym, dragging all of them except Chetney toward it. Delilah unleashes more Necrotic Bursts, significantly wounding Ashton, Orym, and FCG although Ashton expends a mote of possibility to avoid a critical hit. Delilah seems to recover health from their damage. The Burst brings FCG to 0 hit points and he disappears from the battlefield, called back to the Prime Material Plane . The rest of the party continue to whittle away at Delilah, but then Fearne notices that Little Mister 's flaming seeds flung at the tree seem to significantly hurt both it and Delilah. Fearne then begins targeting the tree with fire damage, causing serious damage and setting the tree on fire.\n\nStill in the tree and trying to reach Laudna, Orym hacks at the branches, but discovers her gone, pulled within the tree's trunk. However, his damage to the boughs is enough to destroy them, robbing the tree of a lair action and causing Delilah's shadow form to wither into a skull. Delilah's retaliatory use of a legendary action against Orym with a natural 20 causes massive necrotic damage, taking him into negative hit points and sending him back to the Material Plane, out of the fight. Ashton gives Imogen a Potion of Healing and sets off a stick of dynamite on the tree's roots, severely damaging them. A lair action provides Delilah another Ward of the Corrupt and she Blights Imogen, bringing her health perilously low even with a successful save. Fearne manages to destroy the tree's roots with another Scorching Ray so that only the trunk is still standing, heavily damaged.\n\n![Shadow of Delilah - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFlaming and furious, Delilah uses a legendary action to send a Necrotic Burst at Imogen and hits, but Imogen uses her last mote of possibility to force a reroll and the second roll is a natural 1. On her turn, Imogen drinks the healing potion Ashton gave her, then casts Lightning Bolt on the tree trunk, splitting it in half, destroying it and revealing a white flash of Laudna's form as she is pulled free from the center of the tree. They hear Delilah shriek, \"NO!\" and see a whoosh of white.\n\nImogen, Chetney, Fearne, and Ashton all wake up, joining FCG and Orym on the floor of Pike Trickfoot 's home in Whitestone .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e37-from_the_boughs"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E38-A Dark Balance","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after a very deadly encounter with the Legend of the Peaks, Otohan Thull , with three members of their team dead, two returned, and Laudna left unable to do so. You brought her body back to Jrusar , pulled in some favors with Eshteross , who then pulled in some favors of his own. But then you called out to the leader of the Air Ashari , Keyleth , who brought you to the town of Whitestone . There, she hoped to introduce you to people that could help you in your concern. There, you met Lord Percival de Rolo , who upon learning about Laudna's condition and involvement with Delilah , was extremely unhappy and unwilling to grant aid in this circumstance.\n\nBut Vex'ahlia felt a little more empathetic. Upon calling Pike Trickfoot , the cleric of Vox Machina , to come and try to resurrect your friend Laudna, discovering this lingering connection, the dangers of being uncertain as to how to assure that Laudna came back and not Delilah herself. You traveled to the Trickfoot manor, and she put you all through a unique ritual that projected your spirits into whatever dark pocket dimension it seemed that Laudna and Delilah had been whisked away in the afterlife to.\n\nThere, you traversed a series of odd memories, dark traumas of Laudna's past, battled some of these inner shadows that seemed to linger and be drawn around Delilah's necrotic life force, eventually coming through a shadow version of the town of Whitestone, a twisted leafless version of the Sun Tree where she once hung from, and did battle with the shade of Delilah Briarwood. Upon going through this struggle, this fight, it was discovered that it wasn't just Delilah, but the dark tree itself that represented what was holding Laudna here, it seemed. Through some ingenuity and some well-placed druidic fire spells, the tree was set aflame. After a few of you had been knocked out of this dream, eventually you destroyed the tree, left Delilah screaming, and all of you awoke suddenly, back on the floor of Pike Trickfoot's home.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party all return to consciousness on the floor of Pike Trickfoot 's home, with Laudna 's still body there among them. Pike confirms that the connection between Delilah Briarwood and Laudna, while not gone, is heavily diminished, and begins the Raise Dead ritual by saying there's a slight chance they can break them apart entirely. Pike explains three of them will need to speak to Laudna to convince her to come back.\n\nOrym tells Laudna she deserves to be more than a footnote in Delilah's story, and that she is needed, using Druidcraft to create red poppies in her hair, and succeeds in reaching her. Fresh Cut Grass tries to cast a spell to compel her to return, but fails. Then Imogen speaks, telling Laudna that her presence saved her life, and that Imogen will be there to fill whatever hole Delilah's absence creates for her. The choice to come back is Laudna's; no one gets to control her anymore. But Imogen's message fails to get through as well. The ritual completes, but Laudna is still apparently not breathing. It is not until Pike slaps her that Laudna's eyes open.\n\nLaudna is apparently completely physically unchanged, but very shaky, confused, and fearful. Vex'ahlia stands at the door with her bow Fenthras aimed at Laudna's heart until Pike confirms that it truly is just Laudna, without Lady Briarwood. Laudna, however, is terrified to learn that they are in Whitestone , finally agreeing to at least look around the town before they leave. At Vex'ahlia's signal, two previously-invisible members of the Whitestone Rifle Corps appear from the corners of the room, standing down. Vex'ahlia invites the party to spend the night at the castle. When she opens the cottage door several dozen more riflemen and Pale Guard take aim, including Lord Percival with a large gun aimed at them, but Vex'ahlia calls out her assurance and they stand down as well.\n\n![Form of Dread - Lyadrielle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/da/Form_of_Dread_-_Lyadrielle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221022224735)\n\nLaudna looks around a Whitestone restored to what it was during her early childhood. She is drawn toward the Sun Tree and walks up to it, flashing between her memories of the tree on the last day of her life and the reality of the vibrant life around it now, striking up a brief conversation with a child. When Laudna touches the tree, it feels warm and alive. She slowly assumes her Form of Dread, but it now embodies the Sun Tree.\n\nThey are approached by Lord Percival, who greets Laudna and apologizes on behalf of the de Rolos for what befell her years earlier. At Laudna's urging, everyone also touches the Sun Tree to feel its warmth, and Percival shares that Keyleth has talked to it in the past. When Imogen thanks Vex'ahlia for everything, Vex tells her that they may some day call on them for a favor in return. Fearne thanks Pike for her help, and while hugging her, attempts and fails to pickpocket her holy symbol. Pike appears not to hold the attempt against her.\n\n![Pate - Ashley Stoddard](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/2d/Pate_-_Ashley_Stoddard.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221023042435)\n\nLaudna shares that while in the shadow plane, one of the memories she relived was of creating Pâté . She thinks that memory, along with that of the Sun Tree, may have been reworked into a more positive form. She tosses the doll into the air, and it transforms into a living creature with skeletal wings that greets them in a raucous Cockney accent. Vex'ahlia escorts them to the castle and dinner.\n\nDuring the meal, FCG asks about the location of the Horizon Temple and offers Percy therapy, which Percy declines. Fearne asks Percy for a small gun for her monkey to shoot flaming poop pellets with and to everyone's surprise receives a child's pop gun for him. She promises not to load it with real ammunition. Imogen telepathically has Vex adjust the meal's menu away from items served at Laudna's last dinner at the Castle .\n\nAfter dinner, the party shares with the de Rolos that they have found large quantities of residuum in both Emon and Bassuras , connected to the Cerberus Assembly of Wildemount , and show them a Potion of Possibility . The de Rolos knew of missing shipments but not who was behind them. Imogen tells them of the latticework cage surrounding Ruidus and the city there, and Percy recognizes it as similar to the Divine Gate . The party also reveals the existence of texts concerning the two forgotten gods, and that people investigating the red moon have been being killed. Percival keeps most of the party's residuum but returns a small amount to them.\n\nWhen Percival leaves, Vex'ahlia lingers to apologize once more for Percy, and for what the Briarwoods did to Laudna. She gives Laudna her Ring of Protection before retiring to sleep. Laudna isn't comfortable sleeping in the castle, and asks that they all camp out under the Sun Tree.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Bells Hells and the Sun Tree - C3 intro](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nDuring the night camping under the Sun Tree , Imogen has a dream, which due to Fresh Cut Grass 's nightly cast of Shared Dream , he shares with her. The red storm already surrounds them, and ahead is a shadowed shape moving away. Going closer, Imogen sees it is a male warrior before it vanishes into the dust. She recognizes this vision as resembling those she had of Bertrand Bell and the Lumas twins after their deaths, and her mind immediately goes to Lord Eshteross , hoping that he's all right. FCG learns that spells do not work within the dream, although their will can move them as if flying, so Imogen attempts to contact Eshteross by using the power of the dream, but finds nothing. The storm grows colder and darker as it clears, and above, they see thousands of stars that begin to blink out one by one. They come to consciousness in the early morning in Whitestone .\n\n![Fearne and the Sun Tree - Elaine Tipping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nWhen Imogen tries to give Laudna back the Bloodwell Vial , Laudna gifts it to her. Fearne then uses Speak with Plants to have a lovely conversation with an even-more-relaxed-than-normal Sun Tree. Imogen Sends to Lord Eshteross, worried, but receives no response. She and FCG explain the dream she had, and FCG urges her to try to control them more, and use them. Hoping against hope that it's simply the middle of the night in Jrusar, they breakfast at the castle . On the way out, they encounter Vex'ahlia and Chetney asks her to tell Percival he doesn't need to limit himself to crafting in metal. To demonstrate, he presents Imogen her gift, an intricate wooden clockwork horse.\n\nFCG Sends to Manaia Turei , telling her they'll be ready to return to Jrusar in two hours and she should open the tree portal then. Vex'ahlia then leads them to the Whitestone branch of Gilmore's Glorious Goods , manned by recently-graduated trainee Jerry , who sells them three greater potions of healing and a magical toy griffon (and possibly other items that they will discuss out of character and off stream).\n\n![FCG in the Horizon Temple - KarrahE](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nMeanwhile, Fresh Cut Grass has gone to the Horizon Temple to seek out Guide Osli Kámyda , as Percival had suggested. FCG is seeking answers or guidance, and shows him the medallion of the Changebringer . Osli tells them they simply need to open their heart to Avandra's wisdom, given in signs and feelings at first. If FCG wants to speak to her, just do so. She is always listening, though her responses may be hard to recognize. Osli leaves FCG alone to pray, and FCG asks Avandra just for a sign that she knows they exist.\n\nFCG rejoins the others at the Sun Tree just as Manaia opens the portal and they all run through, with Vex telling Imogen to let them know if they see anything strange. They arrive in the early morning of Jrusar and immediately head to Eshteross's manor. From the outside, everything looks normal, but there is again no response to Imogen's Sending . FCG's Locate Creature reveals a golden line leading into the house. Imogen consults the tracking orb hopefully attuned to Otohan Thull but it shows nothing. They decide to send in an invisible Chetney, and if the front door opens, also send in Pâté .\n\nChetney knocks at the front door, with no response, and then succeeds in picking the very complicated lock. Pâté follows, although he points out that he can't follow Chetney if he can't see him, so Pâté begins leading. Inside, there are signs of a furious struggle, many of Eshteross's defensive traps have been set off, and there is a strong scent of blood. Upstairs, the struggle apparently continued and the smell grows stronger. Laudna directs Chetney to follow a smear of blood leading to Eshteross's bedroom. Within the darkened room, Pâté finds Lord Eshteross's horribly wounded body, face down, with one arm reaching under the bed. Chetney follows, noticing that the blood smells slightly odd, and finds Lord Eshteross's cane lying on the hallway floor. Inside the bedroom, he again notices the odd, off scent of the blood, and also picks up the very faint smell of Otohan Thull lingering in the air.\n\n“\nMy friends, if indeed you have this letter in your hands, then my fate has finally caught up to me. I have done many violent things in my life, some I am proud of, and some I still deeply regret. I've already been long running on stolen time. I feel the looming specter of recompense with every morning, and since our paths have intertwined, I chose to stare it down directly without lament. I could assure that I embraced my end with aplomb and left a mark on my foe they will never forget. In our comparatively brief time together, you have brought a light in [...] The world so continuously ruled by [...] I've been lucky enough [...] You and the late Bertrand Bell were the latest of these deeply appreciated encounters. With every step, I worried you had all stepped into matters far beyond your ability, foolishly marching into oblivion like I once had been. I now know I was wrong. Those that twist the roads of history to their own dark ends want us to believe we can do nothing, they have no power in the face of such ancient, terrible machinations. I know they are wrong. True bravery is to stand in the face of fear and doubt and march ever on. True bravery inspires others to fall in line behind you and defy their illusions. You inspired me to fall in yours, and for that, I thank you. I have many debts to settle and gifts to disperse now that my day is closed, whatever sunset I may have been running from for so long. I look forward to seeing Ellia once more. I look forward to watching you all do great things from whatever realm calls me to rest. Remember me not just as a warrior, but as a friend. A friend in my own awkward way. Thank you. Now go stop this weird moon shit. \n                    ~ Ariks\n”\n\n– \nLord Eshteross's letter to Bells Hells[1]\n[!h]\n\n\n\n\nUnder the bed, Chetney finds an iron lockbox but when he tries to get it, he is slightly injured by a heavy object falling on him from a trap he failed to notice. Inside Eshteross's pockets he finds two keyrings, one of which holds the key that opens the box. The box contains multiple sealed envelopes, addressed to his housekeeper Evelyn Wress , Lex Emenar, Chief Wilder Namin Oros, Ajit Dayal , Orlana Seshadri , Manaia Turei , and Bells Hells . He reads the last one, a letter written to the party to be read in the event of his death.\n\nChetney also finds a page containing Eshteross' maple ginger cookie recipe. The third page is a copy of a portion of his last will and testament leaving to Bells Hells his trusted weapon Turmoil (which they assume is the silvered cane with a heavy ball at one end that Eshteross always carried), and the skyship the Silver Sun with a year of the crew's wages paid.\n\nChetney sneaks back out of the house, still invisible, and briefly fills in the group. They begin moving toward a safer place, but first, Orym catches the \"off\" scent of the blood on Eshteross's cane and recognizes it as the toxin used on Will , Derrig , and the other victims at Zephrah to prevent their resurrection .\n\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e38-a_dark_balance"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E40-Compulsions","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, Bells Hells , upon returning from their chaotic time in Bassuras , losing Laudna , then regaining Laudna after traveling to Whitestone and beseeching the heroes of legend, Vox Machina , to help bring her back (or at least the members which they could find at the time), returned to Jrusar to find Lord Eshteross slain by Otohan Thull , who seems to be acquiring a growing sentiment to following your trail, or at least exacting penance for your involvement. After setting some things right with his self being put to rest, and letting the right people in town handle his final afterlife responsibilities, you were bequeathed in some of his last paperwork the skyship known as the Silver Sun .\n\nNow, with this ship at your beck and call, and with a year of the crew now paid for, you continue your journey in a direction you had previously been wanting to set sail towards, which was the city of Yios in Aeshanadoor , the City of Flowing Light. Deciding between the two different paths you could take (the longer journey but safer one, or cutting straight across the Hellcatch Valley , but a more dangerous route which is why most skyships do not traverse that deeply over the Hellcatch) you decided to take that route, because it's the one more traveled by you though less traveled by most. Along this path, a few nights have gone through, mostly without incident. A brief sandstorm, but through some ingenuity you managed to maintain safety.\n\nAnd then one night, there is a flare of the ruddy moon Ruidus , that seemed to, one, trigger some sort of uncontrolled outburst of the lycanthrope form within Chetney , forcing him to attack his two party members Fearne and Orym , who were on deck during that time of night. They managed to hold him at bay until he was able to regain himself. But the mystery still stands as to why now and why this?\n\nSimultaneously, Imogen , you were pulled during this flare into another dark, red-stormed dream, one that seemed to exert a different balance of power and control than you had grown used to. At the end of this dream, as you plummeted towards the ground at terminal velocity, you awoke, and in a fit of inspiration cast a Sending spell, reaching out to your mother , to which she responded: \"Imogen?\"\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n“\nImogen: Are you all right? Where are you? Are you-- Is there-- Where have you been?Liliana: I'm fine, Imogen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for how long I've been gone. I'm okay. Are you okay?Imogen: If I'm being honest, things are hard. You might know that already, though. Where are you? I want to see you. Can I see you?Liliana: I'm sorry it's hard. I'm sorry for cursing you with this burden. I left because I was a danger. I couldn't stay without knowing what I am. You can't see me because you need to stay safe, and the further from me you are the safer you'll be. Far from me in this destiny.Imogenn: This destiny has caught up with me, regardless of where you are physically. It's all happening. I could use your help and your knowledge.Liliana: I love you, Imogen, more than you'll ever know. And that's why you have to run away from me, Imogen, as far as you can. Run.Imogen: I'm tired of running, Mother.\n”\n\n– \nThe conversation between Imogen and Liliana Temult.[1]\n[!h]\n\n\n\n\nImogen immediately wakes Laudna and tells her what happened. With Laudna's encouragement, Imogen follows up asking her mother where she is and if she's all right, but the response is only that she's fine and apologizes for being gone. Imogen asks again where she is, but her mother insists Imogen is only safe far away from her; she then herself casts Sending to tell Imogen once more to run. Imogen responds, \"I'm tired of running, Mother.\"\n\nImogen is crushed and Laudna tries to encourage her. They move up on deck, where they see (and hear about) the aftermath of Chetney 's attack on Orym and Fearne . Chetney suggests maybe they need to start taking precautions against him at night, and Imogen shares her conversation with her mother. When Orym asks her if she'd remove her powers if she could, she replies that she no longer thinks so. Fresh Cut Grass raises the point that most of them (except Orym ) now have the potential to attack the group, and he shares that Pâté 's new sentience has made him question his own worth as a living being.\n\n![Orym and Ashton - Maddy Marshall](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5c/Orym_and_Ashton_-_Maddy_Marshall.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221114031132)\n\nAlone at one end of the deck, Orym pulls out the sending stone and tells Dorian : \"Hey. Yios bound. Found them, their killers. Bigger than we thought. Real rough, Dorian. Eshteross is dead. Glad you're not here. Wish you were, anyway.\" Ashton comes and sits next to him, checking on how he's doing and saying he hopes that Orym would ask for help if he needed it, since being the one good one in the group sounds exhausting. Ashton himself is finding connection in this group he never thought he would. Orym carefully places a hand on his arm and shares that the group's support is the only way he keeps going. When Ashton leaves for bed, Orym gives him a halfling-sized hug.\n\nAfter several days of uneventful travel, the skyship reaches and passes over Bassuras , near which high winds add a day to the journey. Chetney asks for and receives a set of manacles with which to chain him up at night. While on deck, FCG asks the Changebringer for a sign that she hears him and suddenly sees several bird-like creatures crashing into the ship and climbing aboard. He raises the alarm but is attacked and bitten, and after failing a saving throw is restrained by a creeping petrification. The others quickly join in, finding the creatures are fairly easy to hit and to kill. However, they suddenly realize the creatures were boarding the ship only because they were fleeing from something worse: a gigantic, three-headed white chimera which claws itself on deck and attacks.\n\n![The Chimera - Kiyoko](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/57/The_Chimera_-_Kiyoko.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20221114031559)\n\nThe chimera's fire breath attack is punishing, and it additionally can claw, bite, and use its goat's horns. Laudna utlizes her new tree-like Form of Dread and is able to Bane the chimera, while Chetney activates Lord Eshteross 's legacy weapon Turmoil for the first time. FCG is able to shrug off the petrification before he is turned to stone, while Terana (one of the crew) loads a ship ballista. The remaining cockatrices are quickly disposed of or flee, and the party can concentrate on the more serious danger of the chimera. Fearne moves to the now-loaded ballista.\n\n![Imogen creating the red aberration - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/ff/Imogen_creating_the_red_aberration_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221114031956)\n\nImogen, for the first time, summons a semi-transparent red shade entity , [2] and commands it to attack the chimera, which it does with significant psychic damage, and any creature within five feet of it at the start of its turn must make a wisdom save against psychic damage. The rest of the party all attack the chimera, grievously wounding it until Fearne finishes it off with the ship's ballsta.\n\nFCG heals the badly-wounded Terana. Captain Xandis informs the party that they're now three days from Yios and only a day away from the Gloomed Jungles . The next day, they leave the Hellcatch Valley behind as they pass over the Kaal Mountains to the left that separate the Taloned Highlands of the Stratos Throne from the Gloomed Jungles of Aeshanadoor .\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nAs the skyship sinks down closer to the Gloomed Jungles , a cold rain begins and they lose another half day of travel. Chetney explains that his instructions from Ajit Dayal were that once in the jungle, he should howl at dusk for the Gorgynei . He believes they might be willing to help him learn more about his abilities. Chetney shares a bit more about his background and how he became a lycanthrope .\n\nThe party climbs down a rope ladder to the top of a half-ruined and abandoned military watch tower, and from there to the floor of the forest. At dusk, Chetney transforms and begins to howl, but there is no response for almost an hour. At his request, Fearne wild shapes into a wolf, and the entire party wolf howls into the night. Eventually, there are distant scattered howls from the east in response. Chetney drops his wolf form and suggests they rest there and see if they're contacted. With Fearne still a wolf, they make a fire, and after an hour Fearne sees a shape in the ruins and two yellow eyes. While Laudna requests an interpretive dance from Pâté , Orym spots other eyes in the darkness.\n\nChetney steps out and is met by a tall humanoid figure with wide shoulders and a massive hammer, who pulls back their hood to reveal a deep red-orange weretiger. The tiger tells them they're surrounded and demands the reason for their presence. When Chetney says he's seeking an audience with Divaasheela and was sent by Ajit Dayal in Jrusar , the figure says they've found her. Chetney has come for their help with his condition, which he shares with them. At Annaline's signal, five other figures step forward, including a werepanther, two werewolves, a wereboar, and a werebear.\n\n![Laudna and Manad - Danika Kersten](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nChetney tells them he seeks to learn more about his gift, but Annaline demands he prove his lycanthropy first. Chetney flamboyantly transforms, making Annaline a bit skeptical of him, but she accepts him based on his friendship with Ajit. Imogen telepathically informs Xandis they'll call when they're ready to head out, and to Chetney's delight Annaline begins leading them through the jungle, Imogen mounted on the wereboar and Laudna on the panther Manad (whom she impresses with her Form of Dread). The lycanthropes take a serpentine path which only Chetney has a chance of remembering.\n\nWhen they approach the village, the lycanthropes take their alternate forms and Annaline welcomes them to Barinak , a collection of jungle treehouses connected by rope bridges and ladders. Manad tells them if they tell anyone about the place, they'll be found and killed. Chetney introduces the group and asks if they've had any issues with Ruidus recently, but aside from the normal itch the red mooon always causes, they have not. Annaline recognizes, however, that Chetney is familiar with hemocraft and has taken the Hunter's Bane already. She welcomes him to the Gorgynei and tells him there are many weeks of training ahead, but with the apogee solstice less than three weeks away, that's a problem. Chetney admits he lost control during Ruidus's flare, but learning such control will take time they do not have.\n\nThe gorgynei have recently reached an agreement with the Court of the Lambent Path in Yios to patrol and keep safe the roads in exchange for permission to continue living in the Gloomed Jungles in secret. They live under the guidance of Sahyaadon , the Keeper of the Savage Heart, of whom there is a statue of a humanoid with three bestial heads in the center of town. Sahyaadon is a powerful ancient spirit of the jungle, the protector of both hunter and prey, perhaps under the goddess Serataani . Annaline has dinner brought and they talk further, learning that the Gorgynei sometimes have to kill or chain those who cannot control their inner beast.\n\nAnnaline asks if Chetney has a strong constitution and will. If so, there is something they can try. He assures her he does, and she tells them to rest for the night. In the morning, they will go to the temple of Sahyaadon, Zha'Vrollo . If Chetney is lucky, the spirit will meet with him and either help him gain control of the beast, or destroy him. The temple is about a day's travel away and if the party comes with him, Sahyaadon may judge them as well. Chetney will face trials, be challenged, tested, and judged. Some give into the beast afterward.\n\nAmidst the pouring rain, the party finds makeshift quarters in the village and settles in for the night.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e40-compulsions"}

You went into this odd, undefined, dark space, battled the shades that took the form of memories and traumas, eventually facing the shade of Delilah Briarwood as Laudna's spirit was held within the shadow form of the Sun Tree . You battled and seemed to destroy this tree and separate Laudna from this prison state. You all were pulled out of this and the ritual was completed in which Laudna was returned to life. After which, you finished an evening in the town of Whitestone, said your goodbyes, and then pulling in a favor that wasn't quite taken offered by Eshteross previously to get you to Whitestone, you returned via the Sun Tree once more to Jrusar .\n\nUpon situating yourselves there, you grew nervous after sending a few Sending messages to Eshteross, no response. Upon which, with the help of the now living and independent-ish Pâté and Chetney together delved into a silent and seemingly battle-destroyed interior of the Eshteross estate. Upon searching through, seeing all manner of his traps sprung and gashing and destroying the furniture and walls around you, eventually found, unfortunately, the cold body of Lord Ariks Eshteross. There, where he lay reaching with his final breath towards something beneath the bed, you found a locked chest that contained a number of letters that seemed to be labeled to a number of individuals around the city. Compatriots, friends, who knows? But one of which was labeled as \"Bells Hells\". Looking into it, it seemed to be both a letter acknowledging the long-coming shade of his lifestyle catching up to him and the dangers that his choices eventually coming to a head, he bequeathed to you the ship , the Silver Sun , as well as his handy cane weapon Turmoil . But grabbing up these letters and then stealthily sneaking out of the house, you returned to the rest of Bells Hells, let them know that it looks like some conversation needs to happen about a terrible loss and the growing danger of who you think may have been responsible for this death. As you all, in the setting sun and the coming night of Jrusar, head towards the Spire by Fire , you quickly settle within the interior.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party discusses what to do now, realizing both that they themselves may be suspected of Eshteross 's murder, and that they may bring danger to anyone they contact. They struggle with feeling responsibility for the death through Otohan Thull learning of their connection with Eshteross by reading Orym 's mind during their battle against her. [1] Eventually Imogen uses Sending to contact Orlana Seshadri to tell her of the murder and that they have documents for her. She responds by offering to meet. Fresh Cut Grass Sends to Evelyn Wress , Lord Eshteross's housekeeper, telling her something terrible has happened to Eshteross and not to return to the manor.\n\nOrym checks in with Laudna , who claims she is doing all right but doesn't know how she can ever repay her debt to them all although they assure her there's no debt. Fearne tries to give her the necklace and dolls she took while in Delilah Briarwood 's shadow realm [2] but discovers the items did not leave the shadow realm. Laudna confirms her birth name was Matilda Bradbury but that she \"kind of forgot who she was, being alone for so long\", and renamed herself \"Laudna\". To test if she still has her warlock abilities, she creates an Eldritch Blast .\n\n![Weva Vudol - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/05/Weva_Vudol_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20221107043059)\n\nThe Green Seekers arrive to collect the party and bring them to Eshteross's manor under an armed guard of six Wilders . Out of their sight, Chetney opens and reads Eshteross's letter to Orlana, confirming that he trusted her and that he spoke highly of Bells Hells, and Laudna Mends the seal on the envelope. Once at the manor, they are greeted by Mistress Seshadri and introduced to Weva Vudol , who performs a Speak with Dead ritual on Lord Eshteross. Eshteross's body confirms he was slain by Otohan Thull , and Orlana apologizes to the party for suspecting them.\n\nOrlana asks Olly and Gus to take on the job of locating Otohan, but they decline. When she asks Bells Hells, they agree. They ask her to deliver the remaining letters left by Eshteross and she promises to see to his burial as well as expedite the transfer of the skyship Silver Sun to their name. Chetney admits they opened the letter addressed to her.\n\nThe party bids final farewells to Eshteross. Fearne rifles his pockets and Laudna sends Pâté to steal six bottles of spices from the kitchen, before the party heads to the Soot and Swill and a night's rest. In the morning, Orym shares with the rest of the party the existence of the anti- resurrection toxin in Eshteross's blood, and they ask about the reasons for the attack on Keyleth in Zephrah . Orym doesn't know, but speculates it may have something to do with the ley lines . FCG casts Identify on the blood on Eshteross's weapon Turmoil , learning that the toxin is completely unlike anything FCG has ever seen before but is not magical. He also learns the properties of the weapon itself, and Ashton and Chetney discuss which of them will take it but don't reach a conclusion.\n\nAt breakfast, Pretty greets them with joy. He hasn't found love yet but is content to explore his options for now, and he adds a little extra spice to the breakfast dishes for them, saying their friendship means a lot to him.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party heads to the skyship port, seeking out Port Captain Tang , who tells them the paperwork on the ship is nearly complete and it will be about 15 more minutes. The Silver Sun itself is functional, but not completely repaired. They are welcomed aboard by first mate Khalil Benes and Captain Xandis , who is happy to see Laudna alive again.\n\nXandis tells them Yios , their proposed destination, is about 1100 miles away south-southeast, about 11 days journey. If they travel over the dangerous Hellcatch Valley , it would be two to three days shorter. Chetney is thrilled that the Gloomed Jungles of Aeshanadoor (where he hopes to find the Gorgynei ) are on the way, about a day away from Yios. The ship still needs a few days worth of repairs, but they could attempt to do them along the way.\n\nThey discuss the pluses and minuses of speed vs. danger. FCG wants diamonds, but it takes until sunset to get 300 gold worth. Imogen wants a ruby worth 400 gold (presumably as a spell component), but it would take until the next day. Eventually they decide to delay their departure until the next day, to allow the repairs to be completed, Imogen to get the ruby, FCG to get a commemorative coin from the Variant Coinstores of Duman , and Laudna to recover more fully from the ordeal of the Raise Dead spell.\n\nThe first few days of travel are uneventful. Laudna successfully bakes Eshteross's cookies along the way. Once they cross into the Hellcatch, however, a dust storm with strong winds overtakes the ship. They use ropes to tie themselves to the ship and although several of them are blown overboard, the ropes allow them to quickly recover. The storm, however, adds a day to the journey.\n\nThe next day passes without issue. That night, however, Ruidus flares. Imogen, already asleep below deck, was dreaming of her and Laudna baking cookies when the red storm begins outside the hut. She steps out into it to see a figure walking away into the dust, resembling Laudna, and Imogen frantically runs after her. As she touches her, the figure turns, and what had appeared to be her dark hair is revealed as being the tattered shreds of a black shroud or cloak. Her hair is actually lavender, and Imogen recognizes her mother . Liliana tells her emphatically, \"You need to run.\"\n\n![Orym fighting Chetney - ofteasandherbs](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5a/Orym_fighting_Chetney_-_ofteasandherbs.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20221107043457)\n\nMeanwhile, Chetney is still awake on deck when the flare begins. He feels himself uncontrollably transform into his werewolf form and attacks Orym and Fearne , still on deck as well. They fight back, trying not to be killed and not to kill Chetney. Fearne casts Daylight , almost but not quite snapping him out of his trance, and he attacks her. The Daylight spell then allows him to break free of Ruidus's influence, but his hit points are now low enough that he loses control due to that condition and continues to attack. Eventually, he recovers his senses as the flare fades and he becomes Chetney again. He apologizes, explaining that's never happened before.\n\nBack in Imogen's dream, the wind whips her mother away to disappear into the storm. Above her, she sees the flaring Ruidus, and she is alone in the wind. Angry, she casts a Lightning Bolt on the hut as the lightning marks on her arms grow to fill them completely. Imogen flies upward toward Ruidus, and as the flare fades, she falls back to the ground, waking as she hits.\n\nShaken, Imogen casts Sending to Liliana, saying, \"Are you there?\" After a long moment, the reply comes: \"Imogen?\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e39-the_momentum_of_murder"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E12-Make It Fashion","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, our band of heroes had been pursuing a few variable threads. You had come to Eshteross with information about this strange entity, the Nightmare King which you had encountered, who seemed to be responsible for a lot of the chaos bursting across the city of Jrusar that you had been either hearing of or present for. They also mentioned that they were under the employ of some individual named Armand. Eshteross said this sounds like Armand Treshi , a name familiar to you in some of these other investigations, and it was said that possibly, in the coming event, a ball of sorts, that is being held in under a week here in the city, may be interest in trying to find out more about the individuals involved, if not other ventures.\n\n![Imogen researching - Alartriss](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/98/Imogen_researching_-_Alartriss.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220524192226)\n\nYou also found the individual that Chetney was looking for, Gurge Kisgregg , who gave you some information about where to find out the whereabouts of this troupe of hemocraft -based warriors that had essentially found ways to keep their beast at bay, may be able to teach you. Now with this, you're able to also speak at Eshteross' introduction to Oshad \"The Anger\" Breshio and the family of which he was protecting when two of the family members were killed recently by a very familiar assassination attempt. Gathering a bit of information and a direction into the Heartmoor to find more information, you also finally had a path into the Conservatory that you've been waiting for since your arrival in Jrusar. Late into the evening, you all went up and waited patiently as Imogen went through the library to seek any information that might help unveil answers about her strange reoccurring nightmares and her odd abilities, and you found some. Something, at least. Possible rumors and theories about seemingly historical recurrences of similar visions and dreams by others. And a name, a familiar one, that of your mother, Liliana Temult , before the remainder of this one report was seen torn and missing.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nImogen questions the library scribe about the missing pages and learns the last individuals to use the book were the Lumas twins . When she shares this information with the party, she also divulges that her mother is \"gone\". She never knew her and her father never talked about her, but she hears her in her dreams.\n\n![The ball costumes - Eliza Ferdig](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/24/The_ball_costumes_-_Eliza_Ferdig.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220207221023)\n\nSince it's very late by this point, most of the party head to the Spire by Fire to sleep, while Imogen and Laudna go to Zhudanna 's house, reassuring themselves she is still alive and well. The next morning, they go shopping at the Golden Veil, a high-end clothing shop, for suitable garments to wear to the upcoming masquerade ball. After much negotiation and discussion, all except Dorian purchase new outfits.\n\nThey head to the Trove of Marwa to buy potions and other magic items. Along the way, FCG talks a bit about his goals. After some heavy prodding from Imogen, Chetney reveals to her privately that the velvet sack he stole from Vali Dertrana 's office above Ira Wendagoth 's lair [1] contained 80 platinum, which he is keeping.\n\nAt the Trove, they are greeted by Marwa Endalia , who is uncertain about the identity of much of her inventory but happy to make sales. Imogen sets off an Eversmoking Bottle accidentally while smelling it, and while under its cover Ashton tries and fails to steal Fearne 's ornamental sword, Fearne succeeds in stealing a glass egg wrapped in a leather cord. The party buys several other items and components, including a Rope of Climbing for Orym and the Eversmoking Bottle for Chetney. Laudna makes a mental note to come back in a day or two for one item which Marwa describes but cannot immediately find. As the party departs, Fearne leaves the stolen glass egg on the counter.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party once again discusses possible group names. FCG reveals that their previous group was called the \" Division of Public Benefit \" or \"DPB\". [2] After many other suggestions, they are unable to come up with anything and once again shelve the issue.\n\nOrym and Imogen head to House Lumas where Ela Lumas welcomes them and allows them to search the twins' rooms, looking for the pages torn from the book Imogen found at the Conservatory, but they find nothing. Orym tells her they plan to soon head to the Heartmoor where the twins were killed and asks if they can do anything for her there. In return, she gives him a small gold and silver pin to show to Estani , the family friend who was with the twins when they died.\n\nLater, FCG tells the party what he remembers of the attack in which the rest of his party was killed: the creature had one eye. Imogen casts Detect Thoughts on him while he tries to remember more: It was early morning and he was still in stasis. He saw a lot of blood and some of his friends falling. He watched Dancer take her last breaths with the creature atop her, and then suddenly, it was gone. Imogen can learn nothing more from her link, as the memories are all partial and disjointed. As they finish, Matt out of character tells Sam he takes two points, which he marks down.\n\nAs Imogen readies to return to the Conservatory for more research, Laudna asks her to look for information on the Briarwoods , having a dead woman in your head a year after she's died, and if Laudna gets rid of the dead woman, whether she will lose her powers. Once there, Imogen can learn little beyond that the Briarwoods originated in Wildemount and then raised a bloody incursion in Whitestone , wiping out most of the de Rolo family and taking over. They held power for about five years before being ousted and apparently destroyed by Vox Machina , then had post mortem involvement with the incursion of the Whispered One . Imogen also finds a great deal of information about both spontaneous development of magical powers, and about the nature of the warlock/patron bond. She is unable to determine if her own powers spring from her bloodline or a natural conjunction of magical elements.\n\nAs a few days go by, Orym has a conversation with Fearne and Dorian in their room, asking Fearne about the fact that Ira Wendagoth recognized her last name. Fearne is unconcerned. Her family is basically royalty in the Feywild , though not within the Seelie or Unseelie Courts, and they have lots of enemies. Maybe they should be a little worried about Ira.\n\n![Imogen and the red storm - Stephanie Brown](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThat same night, Laudna wakes to find Imogen having a nightmare. The red storm has returned, and Imogen is locked out of her house. She hears her mother's voice urging her to run. She sees the silhouettes of two young people holding hands before being consumed in the clouds. Imogen frantically runs through the storm before waking. Laudna tells her she said the word \"twins\" during her dream, but Imogen isn't sure what she saw.\n\nThe next day, Laudna runs back to the Trove of Marwa and purchases the Bloodwell Vial Marwa couldn't locate earlier. Meanwhile, Chetney gifts Dorian the toy wooden airship he promised him, and Ashton sets up a mask-crafting party at their place. Each of the party creates a mask to wear to the upcoming masquerade ball, and Ashton's costume makes them look like the Nightmare King . Laudna dresses Pâté in doll clothes for the event.\n\nThe day before the ball, they visit Lord Eshteross . The invitations he has acquired for the ball are for two separate groups, one accompanying him and one accompanying a noble individual they can invent. He explains again that the Oderan Wilds are ruled by the club-like Chandei Quorum at the expense of the common folk. He would like to expose the members and the corruption within it, and therefore hopes to learn its membership. He distrusts House Treshi and seeks confirmation that Armand Treshi is on the Quorum and his connection to the Nightmare King. He proposes they plant a traceable silver ring on him, a duplicate of one he always wears. They will have to get his own ring from his hand and replace it.\n\nThe masquerade ball will be held in the Chandei Quorum's chambers at the apex of the Core Spire , and lodging for guests is provided there. They will meet at Eshteross's manor and travel by two separate sillgoat carts to the ball. Visible weapons must be checked at the door.\n\n![The party's ball costumes - Melissa Hahn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe party decides that Dorian should go as himself, possibly pretending to be interested in employing Armand's Paragon's Call mercenaries. Alternatively, they'll get Armand drunk and charm his pants (and ring) off. Dorian asks if Eshteross can promise his family protection if he uses his real identity, and Eshteross responds everything comes with a risk but he will do everything in his power. The party decides that Dorian, Orym, Fearne, and Imogen will be one group, and the others will be with Eshteross.\n\nThe issue of the group's lack of a name comes up again, and in the subsequent discussion, \"Bells Hells\" seems to gain traction.\n\nThe next night, the sillgoat carriages take them all to the Chandei Quorum headquarters at the top of the Core Spire, where they see the other ball guests arriving through its 20-foot golden arch.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e12-make_it_fashion"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E20-Breaking and Entering","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells had made their way to the Heartmoor Hamlet on the northern edge of the Oderan Wilds , both to meet up with an individual who was present for the assassination of the Lumas twins and gain some information about that thread that has been tugging since the beginning of you meeting each other, and to check into a particular gig that was given to you, Ashton , to meet up with an individual, a Mr. Evon Hytroga , who is the owner, purveyor, and the excitable figure behind the Twilight Mirror Museum here in the Heartmoor Hamlet, who after a botched break-in at Hexum's manor, decided to show off how stringently strong and effective his museum's defenses have been constructed and upped since. You were all sent by Hexum as part of a wager to break in and steal a particular item within this museum before sunrise.\n\nUpon meeting Mr. Hytroga himself, he gave you a few ground rules: You have until sunrise starting at midnight, so roughly five and a half or so hours to find within the museum, which resides somewhere in his ridiculous manor, a particular object, specifically the Wind Folly, which is an earring. You also are not the only ones doing this. There is a secondary team that is sponsored by Mistress Isha Sabanis that is going to be competitively searching for this at the same time. The winner, which can procure this object and return it to the hands of Mr. Hytroga before the sunrise, wins. And should nobody do it, he wins his wager and you all go home dejected. Those of you who survive. To be fair, he did say that he put in a lot of traps and said they're not intentionally fatal. So I'm sure you'll be fine.\n\nBut as you gather yourselves, gather your materials, did some shopping, found out some interesting history and some connections between the ruddy moon Ruidus in the sky, you all gathered outside of the museum. And at the strike of midnight, Mr. Hytroga said, \"Go!\" and you were off.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAs the competition begins, The Verdict immediately scatters into the nearby bushes and disappears. Bells Hells goes the other way, noticing barred windows on the ground, second, and third floors. Ashton and Chetney head to the back of the building where they see a rope dangling from a second floor window and The Verdict's katari and goblin members climbing up it. Ashton shakes the rope, sending the goblin flying and shrugs off a retaliatory Charm Person . Chetney casts Invisibility on himself and begins climbing the rope behind the katari. The goblin also climbs the rope, cutting it behind him about ten feet up, but Chetney is able to leap to a nearby window sill as the two rivals enter the building, then follow behind them into a guest bedroom.\n\nAshton rejoins the others and breaks the glass on a ground floor window, allowing Orym to squeeze through the bars into the dining room within, soon joined by Laudna . After Fearne softens the bars with Heat Metal the others are able to bend them and enter as well. They are in a dining room with doors leading to the kitchen and to the main foyer. While investigating the kitchen, Orym sets off a magical trap, taking damage from flying knives and cooking utensils.\n\nThe foyer holds multiple paintings, two statues to either side of a central stairway leading upward, the main entrance door, and doors both to the dining room where they are and to another room on the opposite side of the foyer. Laudna uses her immovable rod to block the other door when their rivals try to enter through it. FCG uses Locate Object to learn that the earring they seek is below them. While investigating, Imogen triggers the statues' motion-sensing lightning traps and she and Laudna cover them with carpets. Ashton discovers a secret door behind a painting.\n\nMeanwhile, as Chetney follows the katari and goblin, he sets a fishing line trip wire near the top of the stairs, which catches them when they hear a noise downstairs and move to investigate. He continues to follow them as they instead move up a stairway to the third floor. Fearne joins Orym in the kitchen and they hear the voices of three of The Verdict seemingly arguing in the music room they are blocked into by the immovable rod.\n\nBack in the foyer, FCG discovers and dispels a magical trap on the hidden door, and Ashton picks the lock. Laudna reclaims her rod from the door of the music room, through which they can hear their rivals trying the various instruments, followed by a grinding vibration like a heavy door opening. Imogen throws ball bearings in front of the music room door and at the base of the stairs, and Ashton removes the rugs covering the lightning-shooting statues. FCG shouts loudly to Chetney that the door is in the dining room floor.\n\n![Chetney after the booby traps - Dylan Chinn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/31/Chetney_after_the_booby_traps_-_Dylan_Chinn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220418180049)\n\nUpstairs, Chetney continues following the goblin and katari as they explore the upstairs, setting off a glue trap that pins them to the ceiling. When he hears FCG's shout, he leaves the trapped rivals and goes downstairs, getting hit by the statues' lightning and falling on the scattered ball bearings. Orym and Fearne call him over to the secret door through which the rest of the party has descended. As they close it behind them, Orym booby traps it with a stolen bag of flour and scatters lentils from the kitchen over the floor.\n\nThe now-complete party descends into a 40 by 20-foot stone-walled chamber, with large double doors to their right and a corresponding staircase directly across from them. Across from the doors is a platform holding an artifact. Chetney can faintly smell that Tejana has passed through recently. Ashton notices two strangely familiar suits of armor to either side of the doors. When FCG tries to saw through the bar holding the doors shut, webbing shoots out holding all of them but Chetney. Chetney hits Ashton, putting him into a rage, and he frees himself. Chetney then uses fire to free the fire-resistant Fearne, and they eventually help all of the others out, but it has taken valuable time. Ashton batters down the door with his hammer and they reach the next room, finding closed doors leading out to either side, two sets of chitinous Kryn Dynasty armor, and a central artifact resembling the broken frame of a Luxon Beacon .\n\n![Bells Hells hallucinating - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/bb/Bells_Hells_hallucinating_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220418175625)\n\nChetney can smell that Tejana went through the door to the right. As Orym investigates the artifact's dais, the armored statues shift and shoot out gas affecting everyone but Imogen and Chetney. The others all immediately hallucinate the floor collapsing, sending them apparently plummeting into an endless abyss, and FCG's panicked attempt to use his grappling cannon hits Imogen instead. She casts Calm Emotions , calming Laudna, Orym, and Ashton, and mentally communicates to Laudna that it is an hallucination. Chetney slightly wounds Ashton, dispelling the illusion, and they injure the others to bring them out of it as well. Guiltily, FGC casts Cure Wounds on Imogen.\n\nChetney lockpicks the left-hand door while Fearne opens the one on the right, finding the three members of The Verdict they have been following apparently unconscious on the floor. Laudna casts Darkness in the room in case they wake, before closing the door. Everyone but Chetney moves to the outside room while he opens the left-hand door, revealing another exhibit room and a set of stairs leading downward. As he does, the goblin and katari come down the stairs from the ground floor and spot the party.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nBells Hells run into the next room and then through the left-hand door, with Fearne kicking over the mask as she leaves and successfully resisting its effects. Chetney tosses his eversmoking bottle into the preceding room before slamming the door closed, and Laudna wedges the immovable rod under the door handle.\n\nInside, they find a spooky-looking wooden mask and five large marionettes dangling from the ceiling. FCG 's Detect Magic reveals that both are magical. As Fearne investigates, the marionettes suddenly drop from the ceiling and animate as if being controlled by an unseen puppeteer. Roll initiative!\n\nFearne casts Entangle on the marionettes, also catching Orym but preventing most of the puppets from being able to reach the party. Instead, they begin laughing maniacally. FCG, Chetney, Imogen , Ashton , and Laudna all fail their saves, take psychic damage, and start laughing as well, becoming incapacitated. With only Orym and Fearne free, Orym manages to drop one of the marionettes, and Laudna and FCG succeed in breaking free of their laughter. FCG is immediately grappled, however. Ashton and Chetney also succeed in resisting the laughter, but Orym is still entangled and can no longer reach any of the creatures. Laudna drops one, and Fearne gets the rest with Scorching Ray . Imogen keeps laughing but eventually breaks free.\n\nAs they descend the stairs, Chetney and Laudna cast spells to make the entrance to the stairway look like the rest of the floor and Imogen spreads some ball bearings at its top. The room below has two doors and an artifact on an ominous-looking pedestal, the alleged \"Journal of Vespin Chloras \". While the party debates taking it with them, Chetney lockpicks and opens both doors revealing more exhibits. FCG's Detect Magic reveals the direction in which the earring they seek lies, but when Chetney moves toward the door leading there, he triggers the floor dropping and dumping him onto a greased slide into darkness and a soft, translucent floor.\n\n![Orym and Chetney - andromedaisfree](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3e/Orym_and_Chetney_-_andromedaisfree.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20220422012913)\n\nAs Chetney drives a piton into the wall of the small chamber he finds himself in, he realizes he is sinking into the floor. He manages to pull free and transforms into his wolf form, climbing precariously onto the piton. The group above ties a rope around Orym and lowers him down the chute, but the rope isn't long enough to reach Chetney, who notices the floor rising as he begins taking acid damage. They then tie Ashton's ten feet of rope to FCG's twenty-foot grappling hook and add that to Orym's rope, but that still leaves him ten feet above the transformed Chetney as the floor continues to rise and swallow him. To gain the additional feet needed, they make a human chain and Chetney leaps toward the now-closer Orym, barely grasping his hand.\n\nThe group tries to pull Orym and Chetney upward, barely succeeding, but as they reach the top of the chute the seriously wounded Chetney succumbs to his Order of the Lycan bloodlust and attacks Orym. Imogen casts Command on Chetney, ordering him to stop, and FCG heals him just enough that he regains control.\n\nImogen is able to open the door to the next chamber using Telekinesis , but all they can see is a large stone lion. She swings over the pit that opened under Chetney to reach the room beyond, joined quickly by the others. While checking for traps, Chetney notices two tiles that are different and warns the party to avoid them. He picks the lock and opens the door.\n\nFCG's Detect Object immediately identifies the glass case inside the room in which the earring is held, but Chetney notices the two humanoid-shaped alcoves in the room are starting to change color to a deep earthy brown as a substance pours into them and begins forming quickly. They rush to try to break the glass but it is very strong and even Ashton's hammer is only causing slight damage to it. As the humanoid creatures fully form, the party redoubles their efforts both physical and magical to little effect. Two humanoid constructs made of shifting clay emerge, their eyes burning red where their faces would be.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e20-breaking_and_entering"}

Upon looking for information about it, you found that they were hunted by a bounty hunter named Artana Voe . Upon finding this bounty hunter, you discovered that she was hired by an individual named Vali, Vali Dertrana , who works in the Moon Tower higher up the Core Spire. Upon looking into this individual, this fine gnomish figure here, Chetney , snuck into it and barely escaped by smashing through the window. You managed to avoid being found that evening as you convinced most of the denizens of that hour that the place was haunted and, in that brief window before you heard they might be moving any sensitive and possibly important information or details in this space, you decided to go back in.\n\nYou had discovered there was some sort of odd hidden passageway within and heard conversation from below. So, while finishing a date with the chef, Pretty , you all reconvened and decided to, before the morning sun were to rise above and trigger what sort of relocation might transpire in the morning, you delved back into this burgled office and descended these hidden stairs into what looked to be some sort of an odd workshop. Here in the center of it, you saw a large arcane contraption glowing blue with some sort of crystalline blue device in the center. You heard it whirring. In the center you saw tables with strange devices and alchemical implements scattered about with sheets and papers. You saw bars that marked various alcoves in the side like small prison cells. In the distance across the way you saw a man who was being held. And there in the center of all this, an elongated, strange, spindly, humanoid-like figure , a male creature that had two arms and two legs of thin and long gaunt features, long fingernails, long fingers, a hairless, strange, pale, sallow head with no hair, black eyes, no nose, and a jack-o-lantern-like fanged smile, long pointed ears that curled to the back. As he spun around on his stool and seemed to be aware of your presence as you arrived, \"So. What brings you all to my temporary workshop?\"\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nChetney explains that they are looking for Gurge Kisgregg and asks Ira if he is the Nightmare King. Ira laughs and proudly admits it. Gurge is in a barred cell to one side, and Ira tells Chetney he'll have to take up the issue of Gurge's release with \" Armand \", the one footing the bills for the experimentation. As Chetney continues to ask Ira about what he wants with Gurge, Chetney slowly removes his clothing and weapons. He recognizes that Ira is some kind of fey creature. Ira stands, picks up a glowing fist-sized blue crystal from the table, and drops it. A wave of arcane energy erupts from it, and the two tables in front of Ira animate and begin moving forward.

Imogen Blinds Ira and Dorian casts Shatter near Gurge's cell, weakening the bars. The others attack the tables and they notice two chairs are also animated and attack as well.\n\nChetney has continued to undress, and is now in only his underwear. He draws his wood chisel across his chest and attacks a chair. Gurge transforms into his wolf form and manages to break through the weakened cell bars, joining the fight. FCG is able to destroy one of the chairs, Fearne takes out a table, and Ashton gets another chair, but they have caused very little damage to Ira, and he uses a legendary action to cast a fire attack on Imogen which FCG takes half of. Orym takes severe damage from the remaining table and retaliates, killing it.\n\n![Ira facing Chetney - RubyDianArts](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/06/Ira_facing_Chetney_-_RubyDianArts.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220124031727)\n\nThat leaves only Ira. Chetney moves up on Ira and transforms into a werewolf, to the party's delight, but is unable to hit him. They are continuing to take serious damage and not doing much in return. When Fearne gets close to Ira, he begins sniffing her, then says, \"Hm. You smell familiar, like home. Like... Calloway. Interesting.\" He then Polymorphs FCG into a turtle. A melee attack on Dorian knocks him unconscious, but he immediately comes back to consciousness on a natural 20 death saving throw and stealthily alligator-rolls away. Ira uses another legendary action to attack Orym, knocking him unconscious, but he also immediately rolls a natural 20 on his death save and comes back to consciousness.\n\nThe party gets in a little more damage, and on Ira's turn, Ashton hits him with a Temporal Morass stripping his reactions and halving his speed. Ira looks at the party surrounding him and reaches back to flip a switch on the large mechanical device behind him. He then uses his Fey Step ability to move away and begins preparing an acid spell— but then looks at Fearne, sighs, and releases it. He grabs a heavy chest from the desk and tells the party that although he hates to leave work unfinished, he's been paid half and has other interests to ponder. Looking at Fearne, he says, \"You were as resourceful as I would hope. Hopefully enough to survive,\" and winks at her. \"Safe travels,\" takes a bow, casts Dimension Door and disappears.\n\nAshton immediately inspects the machine, which is faintly humming and growing louder. Laudna grabs the papers from Ira's desk. Fearne is totally at a loss as to how Ira knew the Calloways and why they were spared, suggesting she might try to contact her grandmother . The machine begins crackling and everyone runs for the exit, Dorian snatching up turtle-FCG as they go. They leap out the shattered window, the humming of the machine growing increasingly loud behind them. A warden spots them but wolf-Chetney frightens him off. He and Gurge transform back into human form once they're over the wall.\n\nThe party begins moving as fast as possible without an outright run away from the Moon Tower. Behind them, the hum is still getting louder and there are blue flashes, then a gigantic explosion of blue purple energy. Rocks begin falling and they sprint for the gondola. Dorian is hit and knocked unconscious and FCG is hurt enough to transform out of his turtle form, so is able to immediately cast Cure Wounds and bring him to consciousness. As the streets begin to grow chaotic with startled residents, the party continues toward the gondola.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party hustles to the gondola and crosses to the Lantern Spire and a private room at the Weary Way tavern. Gurge tells them that Ira Wendagoth and Ira's boss Armand had forced him to bite three volunteers dressed in leathers and armed to the teeth. Gurge used to be a member of the Claret Orders in Wildemount , a group of \"fringe society monster hunters\", where he became a lycan while on a hunt. He came to Marquet after hearing tales of intelligent werebeasts in the Gloomed Jungles . He finally found the Gorgynei , a sect of warriors using hemocraft , or blood magic, and learned to control his lycanthropy by using it.\n\nChetney admits that he, too, is a lycan, and had been chased out of Uthodurn by the Glassblades after messing up his employer \"something fierce\", and was bitten by a werewolf in the Savalirwood . He sought out Gurge trying to learn to control it. Gurge had hoped his friend Ajit could direct Chetney to the Gorgynei as well, but was captured by Ira before he locate him. Now, however, Gurge wants only to go back to his home, and tells Chetney to go find Ajit Dayal in the Dayal Hall in the Core Spire . Chetney asks the party's help in his search, reluctantly admitting that they are now friends.\n\nLaudna discovers that the notes she scooped up from Ira's lair are now blank. The party then takes their long rest, rising about noon. Over breakfast, Ashton explains Jiana Hexum 's job offer [1] and that completing it would help him clear his debt to her. He also shares that it was her golem that was stolen, precipitating the bounty on Cyrus Wyvernwind , and that completing the task for her might help clear that as well.\n\nFCG runs down the party's current to-do list:\n- in five days, attend the ball mentioned by Lord Eshteross\n- perform the mission for Jiana Hexum\n- check in with Pretty (low priority)\n- meet with Oshad Breshio\n- get Imogen into the Starpoint Conservatory\n- find Armand, Ira, and Ajit Dayal\nFirst, they go to Lord Eshteross and report the events of the previous night. Lord Eshteross recognizes that \"Armand\" is Armand Treshi of Mahaan House Treshi , whom he has long suspected of being a member of the Chandei Quorum . He is looking forward to possibly undermining his influence in the city at the upcoming ball. Eshteross will have a friend look at the now-blank paper from Ira's lair, and he gives Imogen a letter granting her access to the library of the Starpoint Conservatory. He also plans to reach out to a friend in a library in Ank'Harel . He has cleared the way for Orym to meet today with Ginang Ela Lumas , the Matriarch of Mahaan House Lumas , and with Oshad Breshio .\n\n![Orym practicing Zeph'aeratam - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe group heads toward the Lucent Spire , Chetney buying a new wood chisel and Ashton sending a note to Jiana Hexum on the way. They spend a relaxing afternoon at the Diamond Horizon bathhouse. At sunset, they reach House Lumas where they are greeted by Ela Lumas.\n\nOrym tells her about the attack in Zephrah six years earlier, which was very similar to the recent one on her family, and tells her he is seeking those responsible. She takes them to Oshad Breshio, still recovering from his wounds, where Orym explains that Jarett Howarth had told the Ashari of the attack on the Lumas twins. The twins were scholars and researchers of planar contacts, celestial bodies, and the crystal fauna of the Heartmoor . They were in Heartmoor Hamlet with Estani , a friend and retired astronomist from Yios in Aeshanadoor , when they were attacked by three masked figures dressed in black-stained leather armor and wielding poisoned weapons, who cut down the twins before they could be stopped. When killed, the attackers melted into sludge. Oshad suggests Estani in the Heartmoor might know more.\n\n![Imogen at the Conservatory - Keira James](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe party then goes to the Starpoint Conservatory in the Aerie Spire . On the way, Imogen explains that she has persistent nightmares of a red storm, and shortly after they began, she gained her powers. She hopes to find out why through research. Once there, Lord Eshteross's letter grants her full access to the library. Hours of research later, she has learned that there is a theory of a pattern of individuals across Exandria sharing a recurring dream of a consuming red storm. These dreams increase at the celestial solstice every thirty years, and there is worry that the dreamers are touched by fiendish influence, Ruidus tidal corruption, or elemental boundary flares. Among the list of names marked as contributors or subjects, Imogen recognizes one: Liliana Temult , her mother. The remaining pages of the study have been ripped out.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e11-chasing_nightmares"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E17-Heart-to-Heartmoor","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, Bells Hells had seen their friend Dorian off with his brother Cyrus on Ariks Eshteross 's airship to Tal'Dorei to keep them both safe for the time being. Upon looking to delve into some of the mysteries surrounding your recent ill luck in social endeavors here in Jrusar , you ran into the Green Seekers , a pair of well-known investigators here in Marquet and beyond. To build trust with them to absolve yourself of the growing mistrust they seem to have in encountering you, you together delved into the mines deep beneath the Smolder Spire in Jrusar, battled through shade creepers , and eventually stumbled upon on the trail of Lady Emoth Kade , the Shade Mother : a large misshapen entity that seemed to be the source of the ever-mutating shade creeper hordes that were tunneling through the city, stealing and thieving.\n\nYou managed to capture Lady Kade herself and roll her out while escaping the Shade Mother through the help of some ingenuity and the sacrifice of one magical rope into some drill machinery and left in the abandoned mine. After going your separate ways, you managed to gather yourselves and what strength you had left after a long, hard-fought battle. Bruised and battered a bit, you went and got rooms for the night there at the Soot and Swill , where you were looking over a glowing stone that you had discovered within the area of the shade mother's den, as well as you sleeping through an important date you had set.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nAs Imogen drifts into sleep cradling the purple crystal from the Shade Mother 's lair, she finds herself in her familiar dream of walking through a field surrounded by the iron-like smell of an approaching red storm and her mother 's voice in her mind saying, \"Imogen, run!\" She glances down to see the small purple gem in her hand, which seems to offer a different means of escape. As the storm strikes, she runs, calling to her mother, but just as she reaches the safety of the farmhouse, she wakes up to find the purple crystal cradled in her arms. She wakes Laudna and tells her about the dream. Unable to sleep, Imogen goes downstairs, leaving the crystal with Laudna.\n\nIn the morning, FCG seems to have recovered from his glitching of the previous day. Laudna gives Imogen back the bundled crystal and FCG Identifies it as a shard of the Gnarlrock (from the Feywild ) that causes things around it to mutate and change. Laudna asks Fearne about her past in the Feywild, and Fearne says she left to explore and to find her parents, whom she hasn't seen for a very long time. They left many years ago to travel the Material Plane . The last letter from them was from Aeor .\n\nThe party decides to pursue their interrupted plan from the previous day to take Jiana Hexum 's job in the Heartmoor , first stopping by Zhudanna 's to pre-pay rent. Once at Hexum Manor, Ashton introduces the party to Lady Hexum. She goes over the job again: steal a designated object from a \"friend\" of hers, Evon Hytroga , who owns and runs the Twilight Mirror Museum , before a team from another \"friend\" (Mistress Isha Sabanis) can do so. They will receive 500 gold apiece if they succeed, with a possible additional bonus of 500 apiece more if they really embarrass Evon in the process. She also pays them 300 gold for food and travel, which FCG requests and receives in the form of a diamond. Lady Hexum is very interested in FCG, speculating they could sell them for more than 20,000 gold.\n\n![Fearne and Laudna - Magsowo](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a9/Fearne_and_Laudna_-_Magsowo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/230?cb=20220321234929)\n\nThe team splits into three. Fearne and Laudna tell Lord Eshteross all about their encounter with the Green Seekers , Emoth Kade , and the Shade Mother . He warns them to stay on the Honored Trails during their journey. Meanwhile, Ashton, Orym , and FCG head to Krook House where Milo inspects FCG, diagnoses a form of pent-up energy within their metal body, and is also able to upgrade FCG so that switching arms is now included in their turn.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen and Chetney rent five carefully-selected horses and a small chariot-like cart. On the way back, Imogen tells Chetney about the red storm she sees in her dreams, and he suggests that it may be a memory of something that happened to her when she was very young. The thought terrifies Imogen.\n\nAs the party reconvenes, they buy supplies for the trip, then move through the Steps of Jrusar at the spires' base and head out into the jungle on the Honored Trails leading to the Heartmoor.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Rabbit with the Feywild shard - KageSatsuki](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/ab/Rabbit_with_the_Feywild_shard_-_KageSatsuki.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220321203513)\n\nIt is three to four days on horseback via the Honored Trails to Heartmoor Hamlet , five in bad weather.\n\nDay 1 - The party chooses and names their horses and heads northward. Along the way, a four-foot-long timber rabbit leaps out of the brush with a glimmering pink stone in its jaws and darts into the jungle. Orym runs after it and eventually manages to sneak up and snatch the stone from its mouth, giving it to Imogen when he rejoins the party. At nightfall, they make camp and spend an uneventful night.\n\nDay 2 - In the morning, FCG Identifies the stone as a Feywild shard which Imogen keeps. Noting the many recent connections to the fey world, the party questions Fearne about it and she invites them all to visit it with her sometime. She also notices a faint fey energy to the whole jungle around them. The rest of the day of travel is uneventful.\n\nThat evening, during their watch, Ashton attempts and fails to pickpocket from Fearne. In their conversation, he shares that his body wasn't always rock-like and hard. He started to slowly shift when he was about ten or twelve years old, and isn't really sure why.\n\nDuring their watch together, Orym asks Laudna about Whitestone . She tells him she had a lovely agrarian childhood, but things slowly started to change once the Briarwoods overthrew the ruling de Rolo family . When she received an invitation to dine at their castle, her family thought it was a great boon and she attended the festivities. At the castle, she was tossed clothes to wear and served a wonderful dinner before being brutally beaten. Things were a little fuzzy after that, but she remembers being hung from the Sun Tree , and her ears being cut to make them pointy. [1]\n\n![Orym with the blue flower - Maddy Marshall](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b9/Orym_with_the_blue_flower_-_Maddy_Marshall.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/240?cb=20220321204331)\n\nDay 3 - Midway in their travels through a stormy day, a bolt of lightning hits a nearby tree. They investigate and notice a glowing blue-petaled flower in the center of the freshly-split tree. As Orym takes it, a bolt of lightning leaps from it to hit him. FCG Identifies it as a blue Chromatic Rose . During their night watch together, FCG and Imogen simultaneously cast Detect Thoughts on each other, sharing their memories and emotions.\n\nDay 4 - Chetney asks Orym about his moon tattoo, and Orym explains it's to help him remember his husband, Will , who was killed six years ago in the attack on Zephrah by dark leather-clad assassins. That attack led Keyleth to ask him, Fearne, and Dorian to travel to Marquet to investigate.\n\nThe rest of the day passes without issue. The jungle starts to become less lush and dense and becomes marshy in spots.\n\nDay 5 - Travel goes uneventfully. That night, Laudna notices a tiny glowing humanoid figure just hanging around. When it starts to rain, she and Ashton try to talk to it but it neither approaches nor runs away although they sense it wants to communicate. Laudna wakes Imogen but it doesn't respond to her, either, and Ashton makes it a small improvised shelter. Imogen wakes Fearne, who calls to it and it approaches slightly. As Fearne moves toward it, it pulses and glows, and Fearne continues walking past it into the night until she is caught by Ashton. The fairy pursues them, a pulsing tendril extending from its base before it withdraws, and Ashton sees that its face is only an approximation. A 20-foot circle of tentacle-like vines and roots begins shifting around them. They have been lured to the base of a large, 15-foot tall, crane-like plant creature with a heavy sharpened beak and a mane of blood-colored leaves. Its mouth opens, a single vine-like lure dangling in front.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e17-heart-to-heartmoor"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E19-Omens Above","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells had made their trek northward from the large city of Jrusar to handle a couple of elements. One, following a thread of the unfortunate murder of the Lumas twins that seems to have a connection to Orym 's initial goal in coming to Marquet , as well as following up on a thread from Jiana Hexum to perhaps help some of Ashton 's historical baggage. Upon making your way northward for a number of days, you had some interesting encounters, some dangerous encounters, and eventually came to the town of Heartmoor Hamlet .\n\nHere, you began to wander about, take in the atmosphere that you had found yourself, went ahead and got rooms situated, had your horses taken care of for the week, went ahead and went towards the estate that is known as the Twilight Mirror Museum . Met the glorious Mr. Evon Hytroga , and announced yourselves as one of the two chosen groups of this unique barter, this odd, particular attempted burglary that you've been asked to do. You've been told to return at midnight the following day as soon as the other team arrives that have been chosen by one of the other competitive interests, the Mistress Isha Sabanis .\n\nAfter making this conversation, you began to wander back to the town, heading over towards the Blue Herald's Hill where you knocked on the door of the last known individual to have been with the Lumas twins when they were slain, an individual called Estani . You knocked on the door and Estani greeted you there, an elderly orc fellow, orc-elf lineage, who seemed to smile and greet you warmly as he invited you within his abode. As you all began to look around and step through the threshold, seeing the mostly moss-taken townscape around you, this building itself very much being reclaimed by the elements, other than the one piercing metallic device that is prodding through the roof, a unique-looking telescope that is pushing from beyond the back end of the building. You step through the front door into the warm interior.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party enters the comfortable, book-strewn interior, where Estani offers them warm lime juice and biscuits. Orym explains that they are looking into the murder of the Lumas twins , and Estani tells them that he and the twins were walking in the nearby Herald's Hill Garden when three dark, masked, and hooded figures dropped from a tree and attacked, killing the twins. Oshad Breshio , the twins' bodyguard, managed to kill one, which discorporated into black liquid, but the other two escaped.\n\nEstani and the twins had become friends via correspondence about their shared interest in astronomical solstices and specifically in the red moon Ruidus . The twins were studying its occasional, irregular flares, believed by some to be ill portents. Children born during a flare are called \" Ruidusborn \". They are thought to be destined for important things, bear \"strange marks\" on their bodies, and have premonitions, bad dreams, and other odd psychic phenomena. To further their research on the Ruidusborn, the twins planned to go to the Omen Archive of the Aydinlan Seminary in Yios which also holds one of the largest arcane telescopes in Exandria.\n\nEstani has none of the twins' notes or papers—they carried them with them, and their bags were missing after they were killed. He invites the party to join him that evening to look through his telescope at Ruidus, which he describes as a barren, red moonscape continuously bombarded with storms. When Laudna suggests to Imogen that she might be Ruidusborn, Imogen replies that she isn't sure, but she thinks her mother might have been since she was part of the study that Imogen found the partial notes about. [1]\n\n![Frog-Fearne - Dylan Chinn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/41/Frog-Fearne_-_Dylan_Chinn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220409000717)\n\nEstani offers to show them the place of the attack on the twins, a small park nearby featuring an endless stream of water flowing from a weathered stone statue of a man pouring out a pot. Orym investigates the tree the attackers came from, finding a hint of a dried tar-like substance in the branches. [2] Ashton investigates the statue, learning that it bears a very faint enchantment and that he can't reach the end of the hole from which the water is coming. Eventually, Fearne transforms herself into a frog and, tethered by yarn, investigates the hole. The water has strange currents, shifting temperatures, and a strange taste, and Imogen's psychic connection doesn't seem to reach within. Fearne quickly retreats when she sees glowing blue eyes coming toward her.\n\nThe party then splits up to go shopping. Fearne, Laudna, and Chetney buy general supplies at Mosscobble Wares, including fishing equipment, ball bearings, climbing equipment, limes, and a shovel. Fresh Cut Grass and Orym ask about potions that might confuse, distract, or obscure at Witherbough Medicines, learning that a group including a silver dragonborn recently purchased three tanglefoot bags , two smoke bombs, and a Potion of Gaseous Form . Orym buys a single tanglefoot bag, which is all they can afford. Imogen and Ashton go to Knot Forgotten, an antique and hand-carved wooden knick-knack store previously owned by Oltgar , and purchase a creepy marionette as a friend for Laudna's Pâté de Rolo . They also get a jack-in-the-box and some children's toy jacks.\n\nMeeting back up at the Sodden Grange Inn where they're staying, they attempt to find out if the rival party is also staying there, but the front desk person is not forthcoming and they deduce he has been bribed to keep quiet. Fearne tries to induce him to keep quiet about Bells Hells as well with a gold piece, and when Laudna sweetens the deal with a lime, he agrees.\n\n![Estani's Telescope - Clara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/73/Estani%27s_Telescope_-_Clara.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20220423232624)\n\nAt nightfall, they return to Estani's manor, where the professor ushers them upstairs to his telescope. One by one, they attempt to peer through it at the ruddy topography of Ruidus but are having trouble focusing closely. Finally, in the face of oncoming cloud cover, Orym succeeds in adjusting the telescope enough to discern the swirl of movement, and calls Imogen to take his place. She can see that the entire surface of the moon is covered in a storm of red clouds and lightning.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Imogen using the telescope - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/03/Imogen_using_the_telescope_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220425055456)\n\nImogen is disconcerted and confused. She has seen the red storm so often in her dreams, but seeing it while awake is different. She questions why her mother tells her to run from it, and why she saw Bertrand and the Lumas twins within it. Estani tells her the twins had mentioned their continuing research into red storms and that they had discovered something important they wanted to share with him, but were killed before they could do so. He mentions once more their research at the Omen Archive of the Aydinlan Seminary in Yios .\n\nFresh Cut Grass suggests that the storm may be a repressed memory of something that happened when Imogen was very young, but short of forcing her father to talk about it, she doesn't know how to learn any more. She doesn't think he wants to see her. The next step, to her, seems to be to travel to Yios to speak to Professor Kadija Sumal , who spearheaded the study of red dreams there. Now that she's thinking about it, she notices that her dreams' frequency seems to be on a roughly six-month cycle corresponding to the orbit of Ruidus ... and Ruidus is currently ascending.\n\nThey return to the inn, where Ashton and Imogen give Laudna the creepy marionette, which she immediately names Sashimi . They try out the jack-in-the-box on Chetney , narrowly avoiding giving him a heart attack. Ashton rigs fishing line around them as they sleep to give warning if anyone breaks in, and they keep watch as well.\n\nDuring the night, Imogen finds herself in her dream of a familiar field as the red storm approaches. This time, instead of running, she cries out to it, asking what it wants, and takes a step towards it. As she does, it gets stronger and colder. She calls out to her mother, and her mother's voice says, \"Run!\" and does not respond to her questions. Saying, \"I don't want to run anymore,\" Imogen, terrified, walks deeper into the storm. Before her, she sees an unfamiliar woman's figure standing and other outlines stepping out from behind it. She senses the woman is smiling and it is not comforting, but intent, focused, and maliceful. With a crack of thunder, the storm consumes Imogen and she wakes.\n\n![Laudna comforting Imogen - Giulia Valentini](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFearne , keeping watch, sees this and Laudna and Orym wake as well. Imogen tells them the storm felt malevolent, but that this time she ran into it, not away. They are all supportive, telling her that running away wasn't the answer and she should continue trying to do something different, but Fearne notices the lightning marks on Imogen's arms appear to have ever-so-slightly grown, a continuation of a very slow, continuous spread over the ten years during which she has been having the dreams. They eventually go back to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, FCG tells Imogen that although he can definitely cure her blue condition, he'd rather not do it until after the heist to conserve spells. They make their preparations, handing out the purchased supplies, going over their inventories, and buying two more potions of healing .\n\nNear midnight, they head to the Twilight Mirror Museum . Evon Hytroga is standing outside with Hutchin 's group, who they met outside Heartmoor Hamlet . In the introductions, they learn the other group is called The Verdict , and they are indeed the other competitors in this event. Evon explains the rules: Both teams may enter the museum however they see fit, being reasonably respectful of the wares and decor. Unnecessary damage will lead to forfeiture. They are to find, acquire, and bring to him a lapis earring of the mythic djinn Harudan , known as \"Wind Folly\". Evon assures the groups that none of his defenses are fatal. They have until sunrise to bring him the earring. If neither group succeeds, Evon wins.\n\nAfter a little more conversation, questions, and sizing up of the other party, the two competing groups separate by about a hundred feet and the competition begins as Evon shouts, \"Go!\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e19-omens_above"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E14-In Too Deep","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, our group of heroes under the watch and patronage of Lord Eshteross have been dragged into a masquerade ball being held by the mysterious Chandei Quorum , of which the intent was to both discover if possible any membership to the Quorum, which is maintained as anonymous, as well as place a replica of an enchanted ring onto the thumb of Lord Armand Treshi . You bought outfits. You presented yourselves to this event and arrived to where there were drinks and music and many, many upper-crust individuals in the society here rubbing shoulders, making deals, making snide comments and rumors. In the midst of this delightfully chaotic social environment, the Dance of the Crossroads began, in which you began to attempt to make this endeavor viable.\n\nThrough your quick wit, and... dedication to the goal at hand, you eventually managed to achieve the baseline of your goal. The bare minimum required of you. But the evening is not finished, as it is only part way through. After this ring was placed upon his thumb, the dance come to a conclusion, the machinations of other things transpiring seemed to been followed by Chetney , who wandered out to discover that Cyrus , the brother of Dorian was in attendance to the party, seemingly with his own ideas, and had wandered off further down the left hallways, deeper into the chambers beyond.\n\nUpon searching for him, you also discovered that another figure that you had just met that evening, that seemed to have some communications with Cyrus and Lord Armand Treshi, known as his Lady Emoth Kade , had gone off to the side, looking a bit odd, a bit out of sorts, a bit ill in some ways, had been doing some sort of a burglary of her own in one of these chambers. And seemed to be in league with some of these shade creepers that you had encountered in previous moments not but a week or so before.\n\nWhile this is happening, Ashton , who had created a mask in the image of the Nightmare King Ira Wendagoth , seemed to draw the attention of Lord Armand Treshi, who had some dealings in secret with the Nightmare King, who then notified the captain of the Paragon's Call that are present at this event. This General Ratanish approached you asking questions and pulled the mask off your face, in which you responded by slapping him square in the middle of this event. He slapped back and it is now seeming to lead to a duel, a fisticuffs throw down on the outside of this event, in which the hustle and bustle of the chamber has now shifted from their own political attempts at making deals, and now enthrallment with the coming violence that is drawing its way to the outside of the chamber. As the rest of you are gathered, the crowd, abuzz with conversation, excitement, claps, murmurs, begins to shift to the outside under the stars, just upon the grassed landscape on the exterior of the Chandei Quorum chambers. There, amongst the glowing pedestals with nightlights and the various carriages and carts and sillgoats that have brought individuals up through the entire evening then are placed off to the side to rest, there is an open space here the crowd seems to be already be aware is a common dueling ground when events like this transpire and people come to a disagreement. The crowd begins to shift and encircle the space as you feel this is where it’s going to happen.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![The Duel - Thomas Lue](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/2e/The_Duel_-_Thomas_Lue.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220221021632)\n\nImogen and Laudna stay inside away from the crowd, while the rest of the party follows the crowd outside to watch the fistfight. Ratanish invites Ashton to throw the first punch, and the fight is on. Since it is a fistfight and both participants are raging, little damage is done by each hit but Ratanish deals extra fire damage with each blow while Ashton's barbarian path skills are largely confined to fights using melee weapons. From the sidelines, FCG pumps buffs and healing into Ashton and the combatants continue to trade blows, reaching a level of mutual respect wherein Ratanish tells Ashton that if they want work, Ratanish could provide it. He then finishes the fight with a critical hit knocking Ashton unconscious. With permission, FCG heals Ashton while Ratanish does a sales pitch for Paragon's Call to the gathered crowd.\n\nGavis Aranda , the Face of the Chandei Quorum , is listening intently to a well-dressed human woman in her 50s (Mistress Orlana Seshadri ) whispering to him, before she goes to Armand Treshi and begins having a quick, intense conversation with him as well, glancing toward Ratanish.\n\nChetney quickly explains to Imogen what he saw in the back rooms, and they pass the information to Dorian . Imogen recognizes that Emoth Kade and her minions sound a lot like Dugger and the shade creepers . Worried, she casts Sending to Cyrus , and he responds that he's fine; he's paying his debts.\n\nFearne tells Lord Eshteross they were successful in planting the tracking ring on Lord Treshi, and FCG gives Treshi's own ring to Eshteross. Fearne asks for and is given it, and immediately wears it despite being warned to keep it hidden. Lord Eshteross urges the group to leave the ball immediately now that their task has been successfully accomplished, but Imogen explains what happened with the shade creepers and Emoth, and that Cyrus is involved and might be in danger. Eshteross agrees to get the keys to their rooms on the premises in order to gain access to the back hallway but urges them to act quickly and quietly.\n\nLaudna has seated herself alone at a table and attempts to make eye contact with Mistress Seshadri. Eventually she uses her Unsettling Presence to draw Orlana's attention and introduces herself as \"Lorelei de Rolo\". Laudna tries unsuccessfully to pump her for information about members of the Chandei Quorum .\n\n![Ashton after the fight - Dylan Chinn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/57/Ashton_after_the_fight_-_Dylan_Chinn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220222003438)\n\nMeanwhile, three members of Paragon's Call approach Ashton and invite him to converse privately with Ratanish. Ratanish questions Ashton about the Nightmare King mask, but Ashton tells him only that the reason they were at the ball had nothing to do with the Call. Ratanish accepts this, but advises Ashton that in the future, when they are involved in the destruction of property within Jrusar, such as the Moon Tower, not to immediately show their face in the center of its politics.\n\nFearne approaches Ashton and FCG, filling them in on the situation in the back bedrooms. FCG convinces her to let him go with her to investigate.\n\nChetney notices two people dressed in functional green talking familiarly to the guards in back before being admitted to the rear bedrooms, and Dorian identifies them as members of the Green Seekers , well-known detectives with a strong moral compass working in Ank'Harel , the Oderan Wilds , and the Hellcatch Valley . Chetney and Dorian move to follow, trailed by Fearne and FCG, and Fearne and Dorian are admitted but are escorted to the bathroom by one of the two guards.\n\nAs Fearne chats up the guard, Dorian casts Minor Illusion to create the voice of a woman screaming from the bedroom Chetney had indicated. This draws both guards away to meet up and investigate, followed by Fearne. Chetney and FCG seize the opportunity to head into the darkened hallway as well. Fearne reaches the slightly open doorway the guards had entered and hears strangled screams, gurgles, and wet chittering from within, followed by heavy dragging and non-human conversation. FCG goes in to investigate and sees two blood trails leading into the adjacent chamber. He calls in the three others and they hear noises coming from the other room.\n\nSuddenly, they hear a creepy voice: \"What are you doing in these chambers?\" It comes from Emoth Kade in her transformed monstrous form, crawling above them on the ceiling.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nLaudna , Orym , Imogen and Ashton are still in the ballroom and have noticed the rest of the party is missing. Lord Eshteross has collected the keys to their suites, and they decide to go see if everybody else is dead. They head toward the currently unguarded doors.\n\nBack in the bedroom, Lady Emoth drops to the ground, blocking the exit, and the battle begins against FCG , Fearne , Dorian , and Chetney . Dorian casts Dissonant Whispers on her, forcing her back out into the hallway. Chetney reclaims his chisel from inside FCG and imbues it with flames, then runs to the doorway leading further inward and sees the two wounded guards lying on the floor within, along with two shade creepers, soon joined by two more. As the fight continues, Fearne summons Little Mister in the room with the wounded guards, causing them additional fire damage as well as damaging the two creepers there.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party arrives in the hall from the ballroom and hears the commotion. They start running toward it and join the fight. Chetney uses his special poison resistance-granting healing potion to keep one of the injured guards from dying, but the other one expires. The party continues to hit the shade creepers, gradually killing them and trapping the last one under a fallen bookcase, where Ashton puts it out of its misery by dropping the bookcase on it again.\n\nBadly wounded, Emoth dashes for the interior room and the hole leading down into the depths of the Core Spire , muttering, \"She'll help me,\" as she goes. The party follows as best they can and unleash attacks at her, trying to kill her before she can escape, but she disengages to avoid opportunity attacks and vanishes into the hole in the wall.\n\nChetney drops his werewolf form, and confirms with the surviving guard that he will tell the authorities that the party came to his rescue rather than causing the mayhem. They learn the room was assigned to Gryz Alakritos . Orym attempts to explore the hole through which Emoth escaped but it is deeper than his rope.\n\nJust then, they hear Cyrus 's voice outside in the hall, protesting that \"they\" have the wrong person. Dorian and Laudna run out and see a shackled Cyrus being escorted by a guard and the two Green Seekers. As the party runs out after them, Imogen tells the injured guard that the party is named Bells Hells .\n\nIn the ballroom, following Cyrus and his escort, Laudna casts Darkness on the ceiling as a distraction but it is quickly dispelled. Dorian throws a smoke grenade at the guards holding his brother and dashes into it. When he bumps into one of the Seekers holding Cyrus, he successfully Charms him, but the other Seeker is holding Cyrus's other arm. Just as she sees Dorian, she is whacked on the head by Lord Eshteross's cane as he appears out of the fog. With a natural 20, Dorian convinces the Charmed guard to allow him to take Cyrus away and Lord Eshteross whispers, \"House. Now.\"\n\nLaudna uses her Form of Dread and shouts at the partygoers to get out, creating massive confusion but alerting the guards. As Dorian escorts Cyrus toward the edge of the smoke cloud, he casts Invisibility on him and they succeed in reaching the outside unnoticed. FCG and Imogen cast Calm Emotions on all but one of the remaining guards. The uncalmed guard is having none of their protestations of innocence until the guard Chetney saved during the fight comes in and vouches for them, but they are still being regarded with suspicion and the guards will remember them. The Seekers begin searching for Cyrus.\n\nImogen casts Sending to Dorian and learns they're at the carriages. The rest of the party joins them and with a very tense Lord Eshteross, they travel to his manor. Once there, Dorian reveals the invisible Cyrus, who explains that one of the Hubatt Corsairs occasionally worked for Lady Emoth, who had worked with Dugger for a while. Emoth hired him to help her steal things at the ball in return for part of her \"great treasure\". Emoth spoke often of a business partner she worked with that she referred to as \"Mother\". When he was arrested, however, the guards thought he had been involved with the recent destruction of the Moon Tower by the party. The group realizes the authorities are confusing Dorian and Cyrus.\n\n![Dorian's farewell - Casu](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/90/Dorian%27s_farewell_-_Casu.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220221032734)\n\nCyrus is in despair and offers to turn himself in, since he can't go home like this. Eshteross offers to smuggle him out in his skyship to Emon , but points out the guards will be looking for \"a certain type of person\", staring pointedly at Dorian. Reluctantly, Dorian agrees to go with Cyrus to help him. The party unhappily say goodbye to him, and over wine, they toast to their new name, Bells Hells. Many farewells are said. Dorian realizes that, due to the way he last left Emon, [1] they really shouldn't go there, but move on as quickly as possible. Both Fearne and Orym give him money to help him on his way, and over wine, song, and stories, they enjoy each other's company until it is time for Dorian to leave.\n\nLaudna asks Lord Eshteross if he is mad at them, and he tells them he's actually proud of them. They accomplished their objective.\n\nAs the carriage holding Dorian and Cyrus pulls away, left floating via Levitate is Dorian's toy airship. A child on the street runs up, snatches it, and runs down the street.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e14-in_too_deep"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E15-The Tunnels Below","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, the Bells Hells had quite an eventful evening at the Quorum 's event here at the top of the Core Spire , where there were fights. There were dances. There was subterfuge. There were encounters with monsters in the middle of the night. There were arrests. There were escapes. And as you all rushed back to the abode of Lord Eshteross , it became quickly apparent that Dorian 's brother Cyrus had fucked up so deeply that both him and his brother have to skip town.\n\nWith Eshteross' help they were both given passage onto his personal skyship , which had just finished coming into port and offloading its goods, and decided to sent it over toward Tal'Dorei , at Dorian's request, where he feels he has some familiar friends to lay low with and hopefully figure out a way to fix these troubles from afar. In the interim, you had your own challenges to look towards, your own mysteries and dangers that lie ahead. As you watched him leave in the wee hours of the morning, you all went back to rest and decide what the next path lay for you.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party completes a long rest at Lord Eshteross 's home. In the morning, Chetney presents Ashton with his gift, an articulated wooden hand with movable fingers. Fearne feeds Lord Treshi 's ring to FCG for disposal, and Lord Eshteross assures the party that the replacement ring they placed on Treshi will allow Eshteross to track his movements.\n\nThey discuss the events of the masquerade ball:\n\n- Treshi was at the party with Lady Emoth Kade , and Emoth was a \"jelly beast\" similar to Dugger . She also mentioned a \"mother\".\n- Orlana Seshadri chatted with both Gavis Aranda and Treshi. She is from a mid-level Mahaan house , low enough in station that Ariks Eshteross didn't suspect them to be involved with the Chandei Quorum .\n- Eshteross worries the events of the ball bolster Treshi's push for increased security in the Oderan Wilds . Eshteross remains unsure why Treshi is so keen on private mercenaries and wonders if the investment is monetary.\n- Treshi is uncomfortable with his connection to the Nightmare King .\n- Emoth was robbing people at the ball, though Emoth's goal there is unclear.\n- Ashton shares that Ratanish knows the party was connected to the destruction of the Moon Tower.\n- Eshteross optimistically hopes to oust Treshi from the Quorum and worries for the Wilds if the rest are also involved in Treshi's schemes.\n- Eshteross believes Ajit Dayal is a good person, though often a target for exploitation by the less scrupulous.\n- Eshteross has analyzed the vial of shade creeper goo the party gave him and determined it is a lubricating excretion.\nThey discuss the mission Jiana Hexum gave Ashton to steal an item from her rival in the Heartmoor [1] and decide to visit her to see if she can provide a means of traveling there.\n\n![The Green Seekers - Gnach](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/23/The_Green_Seekers_-_Gnach.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220307190100)\n\nA few minutes after leaving Eshteross Manor, they notice they are being flanked by the two Green Seekers ( Gus and Olly ) seen at the ball, who \"invite\" the party to join them for a private chat within a magical dome cast by Gus. Olly explains they've noticed the party's connection with some of the weird things happening recently around Jrusar , particularly the destruction of the Moon Tower.\n\nAfter introductions, the party shares their recent experiences, including with the \"jelly people\" like Dugger . The Green Seekers immediately connect this with the recent incursions of shade creepers , and the party tells them they believe they need to investigate the tunnels into which the creatures disappear. The Seekers had discovered the Nightmare King 's lair beneath the Moon Tower and believe there has been a cover-up by the government of Jrusar along with other underhanded political machinations. Eventually, the party persuades the Seekers that they are on parallel investigative paths and that they too are seeking to do the right thing. The Green Seekers agree to work with them for now.\n\nThe Seekers had also reached the conclusion that answers lie beneath the Spires of Jrusar, and the party agrees to join their investigation and postpone their trip to Heartmoor Hamlet. The Seekers want to bring back evidence of the strange shade creepers, preferably in the form of a living Lady Emoth. The entire group heads to the Smolder Spire and the Underrush Mining Operation Facility at its base. Once there, Gus reluctantly asks for Ogdes Friez .\n\nOgdes greets Gus, saying it's been some time. They have an uncomfortable conversation before Gus asks him for a favor. Equally awkwardly, Ogdes invites them inside the mine to talk.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nOnce inside the mine, the awkwardness and thinly veiled hostility between Ogdes and Gus becomes even more apparent. Ogdes tells Gus that in order to help them by giving them access to the mines, he wants an apology and his furniture back from when they lived together. But he agrees weird things are happening. The Crownset Cavern portion of the mines has been shut down for months with no clear reason and the workers from that area were moved elsewhere.\n\nFCG steps in with some relationship counseling, convincing Ogdes to take them to Foreman Shotan Bruo . Shotan is inside his office and only reluctantly admits them but recognizes the Green Seekers and seems nervous and willing to cooperate. Laudna intimidates him anyway, startling him into tripping over a stool and knocking himself out. A search of the office reveals Shotan seems to spend most of his time there but it contains suspiciously little.\n\nBefore FCG casts Cure Wounds on Shotan, bringing him to consciousness, Chetney searches him and takes some brand-new knives and 30 platinum he finds. They question him, learning the Crownset was closed by order of the Underrush family, owners of the mine. Gus bends Shotan's fingers backwards until they break, but he reveals almost nothing beyond that he's being paid to keep the mines closed. By probing his thoughts, FCG learns House Treshi was behind the order and the payments, but \"she\" hasn't been by for a while. Shotan grows even more terrified when they mention Emoth Kade .\n\nShotan leads them to an elevator going deeper into the mine. Before they leave, Gus casts a spell on him convincing him to stand guard there. The descent is long, at least 15-30 minutes, but eventually they reach the bottom and a dark tunnel with a familiar strong musty odor overlaid with an acrid smell of decay. Preparing for battle, they see multiple shade creepers approaching along the floor, walls, and ceiling. Roll initiative!\n\n![Imogen casting Seething Storm - 6ix](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d6/Imogen_casting_Seething_Storm_-_6ix.ty4.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220307165120)\n\nAs before, the shade creepers are easy to kill but can also deal significant damage, and there are a lot of them with more continuing to arrive as the battle progresses. There are also three mutated acid-spitting shade creepers with four arms and a split jaw. They finally manage to kill all the visible shade creepers and hear the feet of others scurrying away. FCG uses Aura of Vitality to heal the party, particularly the seriously wounded Orym .\n\nChetney volunteers to scout ahead while invisible, following the skittering sounds. As he goes further in, he notices the viscous slime growing thicker and forming slime cocoons on the wall. There are occasional piles of bone and clothing. Eventually he reaches a more open area, where about eight shade creepers, including two of the larger, mutated ones, are gathered around a humanoid figure cocooned into the wall of a pillar amid congealed slime. One of the creepers claws the cocoon open, revealing Lady Emoth Kade within. As she emerges, Chetney can see her form is not fully humanoid and has holes in her back through which she breathes. She begins smelling the air, turning toward the invisible Chetney, who immediately scuttles away and reports to the group what he saw.\n\nThey decide to head there quickly and stealthily, remembering that the goal is to bring Emoth back alive. Gus plans to soften up the enemies with an ambush fire attack from invisibility, while Olly displays a pearl that she says, if she can get close enough, will make Emoth be at their beck and call. Chetney volunteers to run into the cave to draw the creatures' attention to him rather than the party.\n\n![Mother - Clara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/02/Mother_-_Clara.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220309202926)\n\nThey advance slowly and none too stealthily until Chetney, in the lead, is about 50 feet from the creatures gathered around Emoth. He dashes into the room, arcing around the enemy, and they shift to follow the sound of his footsteps. When he reaches the other side of the pillar, he sees it opens out into a much larger room, and that Emoth is nowhere in sight. Behind him, Gus's promised Fireball takes out the creatures still gathered around the pillar.\n\nIn the chamber beyond, Chetney sees two figures working at tables and Lady Emoth in the center looking up. Above her, attached to the wall, is a gargantuan mass of pulsing flesh like a 60-foot slug. At its front, a nightmarish drawn-out humanoid torso emerges with four 10- to 12-foot long arms. Arms raised, Emoth says to it, \"Mother, we have visitors,\" and looks directly at the invisible Chetney.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e15-the_tunnels_below"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E13-A Dance of Deception","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, our group of heroes had, after undergoing numerous investigations of their own, encountering some dangers and some curious, mysterious figures, they found themselves invited alongside their patron, Lord Eshteross to a masquerade ball transpiring at the Chandei Quorum chambers. This presented an opportunity to, one, seek out some possible bits of information that were important to Eshteross' disinterest in the the current ruling class of the city, and specifically, to plant a replica of Armand Treshi 's ring onto his hand to replace the one he always wears on his thumb, that can be used then to track his whereabouts after the party. As to how you did that, well, you've proven to be somewhat creative and capable. That is being left to you.\n\nSo after purchasing some fancy outfits, crafting or receiving unique masks, you are divided into two troops that were set on their path via carriage to the top of the Core Spire . So after you've begun to crest around the sunset time of day, the oranges and purples and golds that begin to spread across the rock and stone dome structure, this massive event hall, you pull up in your separate carriages and watch as the rest of the invitees begin to, or have been emerging from their respective carriages, carts, or just walking from their neighborhoods to the space. They begin to step along the long carpet, through the large golden arches into the interior. However, you are still within your carriages with a few moments to figure out your final plotting and interest.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Laudna in costume - @porzioart](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b2/Laudna_in_costume_-_%40porzioart.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220214211147)\n\nTeam Dorian consists of Dorian , Fearne , Orym , and Imogen ; Team Eshteross is Lord Eshteross , Chetney , Laudna , FCG , and Ashton . As their carriages approach the gates, both groups try to quickly develop plans to replace Armand Treshi 's ring, and hide what weapons they can on their persons. When they arrive at the ball, they enter and pass through security successfully. Dorian is announced as himself, Brontë Secondsun of the Silken Squall . Lord Eshteross's appearance is met with surprise by the assembled crowd of about 150 people.\n\nGinang Ela Lumas and Oshad Breshio are present, as is General Ratanish of the Paragon's Call . Lord Treshi arrives accompanied by a young half-elf woman , and they immediately split up as he begins to mingle. Gryz Alakritos , headmaster of the Allegiance of Allsight in Ank'Harel overseeing research into history and ruins, approaches Eshteross to commiserate about their mutual distaste for social events, revealing he came with Ajit Dayal .\n\nDorian is approached by a man in his 60s who introduces himself as Preston Drodelon , the Lord of the Quadroads in Vasselheim [1] who has now moved on to the city of Yios in Aeshanadoor . He points out Gavis Aranda , the Face of the Chandei Quorum . Orym notices that Cyrus Wyvernwind , Dorian's older brother, is also present and speaking to the half-elf woman that arrived with Lord Treshi.\n\n![Introducing Dorian's party - Aviv Or](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/ec/Introducing_Dorian%27s_party_-_Aviv_Or.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20220216002158)\n\nGavis Aranda gives a brief welcoming speech, interrupted by anonymous voices from the crowd asking what the Quorum is doing about the recent attacks in the city. He assures them they are being handled. FCG overhears a conversation mentioning that the Stratos Throne turned down an invitation to attend. Ashton notices that the half-elf woman, Emoth Kade , has moved nearer the exit and is now sitting alone and appears to be waiting for something. Lord Eshteross identifies her as an apprentice in the Treshis' Gold Guild and Ashton approaches her but is unsuccessful in picking up a conversation.\n\nGavis Aranda approaches the group expressing fascination with automaton FCG and introducing himself as being from the Aranda Guild of Beautification as well as being the Face of the Quorum. He makes polite conversation and mentions the Dance of the Crossroads will begin soon, a good opportunity to meet a lot of people quickly.\n\nOrym asks Chetney to go keep Cyrus busy and distracted, so he won't inadvertently interrupt Fearne and Dorian's play to get Armand Treshi's ring, just as the Dance of the Crossroads begins.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![The Ball - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/ca/The_Ball_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220221022947)\n\nLaudna asks General Ratanish , who is accompanied by multiple other members of Paragon's Call , to dance with her and he accepts. Meanwhile, Chetney locates Cyrus Wyvernwind in the crowd and confronts him for his stupidity in being present at the ball. Cyrus explains that he met with Emoth Kade to get information on some scores he could make at the ball while folks were distracted, trying to pay off his debt. At that moment, she approaches and dances off with him.\n\nOrym , Imogen , and FCG all get closer to Dorian and Fearne on the dance floor to be ready for the attempt on the ring. There is much discussion about exactly what they're going to try and little agreement, but Dorian ends up with the tracking ring as he and Fearne join the dance and begin trying to get closer to Armand Treshi by working their way via other partners as the dance continues. As they do, Imogen tries Telekinesis on Armand's ring but it fails to loosen it.\n\nFearne succeeds in snagging Armand at the next change of partners. Reading his thoughts, Imogen learns he is suspicious of Fearne as another fey creature after his dealings with the Nightmare King . As he spins her in the dance, she manages to pull his ring from his thumb as if by accident, and at Imogen's urging drops it just as the dance crescendos. As Armand searches the floor, Dorian kicks the real ring away but Armand notices and goes toward the sound, ignoring Dorian's attempt to pull him into the dance. FCG manages to reach the ring first and snatches it, unseen by Armand. Dorian throws the tracking ring to Fearne, who ungracefully catches it.\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna has been dancing with and flattering General Ratanish. He shows her a symbol of the Duskmaven , telling her he noticed she walks between the natural boundaries of life and death.\n\nImogen has been crawling on the floor, pretending to search for the ring. Both FCG and Fearne move towards her, Fearne using Primal Savagery to scare away potential dance partners on the way. Armand confronts Imogen, demanding to know if she's found the ring yet, and telling her to keep looking. Fearne reaches her and slips her the tracking ring which Imogen immediately gives to Armand, who accepts it churlishly and puts it on.\n\nChetney continues to watch Cyrus, and sees Emoth leave the room. He follows her but is confronted by two wardens at the door. He tells them he is going to the bathroom but they are suspicious and continue to watch him. Chetney sees Emoth to the right and hears a door close. He hides and turns invisible, but accidentally knocks over a vase bringing the alarmed armed guards toward him.\n\nLaudna continues to dance with various partners, and notices Vali Dertrana watching Ashton in their costume as the Nightmare King. Ashton notices as well, walks toward him and bows. Disturbed, Vali looks toward Armand but moves toward Ratanish, holding a brief conversation and pointing toward Ashton. Ratanish nods and approaches Ashton.\n\nThe guards are searching for Chetney with their spears sweeping the air. Chetney is able to evade them and dart past when they are distracted by another ball guest claiming to need the bathroom. Chetney uses his sense of smell to catch Emoth's odd, moldy, earthy odor and determine which door she went through. Listening, he hears a grinding noise within. He slowly opens the door, but it squeaks a bit. The room inside is empty, but a figure from the connecting room pokes its head in and moves with unnatural speed to the doorway where the invisible Chetney is standing. It is a sweating Lady Emoth, who peers suspiciously into the hallway, then closes and locks the door. Chetney retreats back into the ballroom.\n\n![Ratanish and Ashton - Dylan Chinn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nMeanwhile, Ratanish confronts Ashton, asking their name which Ashton declines to give. They tell Ratanish that the outfit was a gift and Ashton was paid to wear it at the ball, but Ratanish doesn't believe that at all and rips the mask away. Ashton slaps him, which Ratanish returns. The confrontation escalates, politely, and they agree to take the matter outside for a duel, followed by most of the fascinated crowd and the rest of the party including Lord Eshteross. FCG holds Ashton's cloak and uses Sympathetic Binding on him.\n\nThe still-invisible Chetney whispers to Orym what he saw while following Emoth, and suddenly realizes that the other ball guest in the hallway was Cyrus. Spitting curses at Cyrus under his breath, he goes back to the hall himself. No one is in the bathroom, and still muttering, he goes to the door of the room where he saw Lady Emoth and succeeds in picking the lock. He slips inside as it opens.\n\nInside, he sees a very small cloaked figure scooping things out of the opened desk drawers and stuffing them in a satchel. The musty smell is strong. Several more of the tiny figures are in the next room, also grabbing things. Lady Emoth is there as well, her eyes black and darkened veins in the side of her neck. Her arms are longer and sweat drips off her face in a thick, mucus-like pattern. She appears to command the creatures to drag their full satchels into the adjoining room, and Chetney hears the dragging sound of shifting furniture again. As he watches, her bones shift back into place and her skin tone regains a more normal appearance. She walks toward the still-open door and Chetney scuttles through it before she can close it.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e13-a_dance_of_deception"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E16-The Shade Mother","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, the Bells Hells , after just barely escaping the chaos of the ball at the top of the Core Spire here in Jrusar , returned to Eshteross ' manor where you saw off your friend Dorian and his brother who were currently figures of interest in the events of that night and nights before. The next morning, you went to seek out possible paths of escape from the city before discovering that you were being followed by the Green Seekers , a pair of very well-known investigators that were present at the events the night before. They took you off the side of the road and proceeded to interrogate you in a semi-public space, and through some communications, some persuasive discussions, and putting a few things on the table in the open, beginnings of trust were granted, and you decided that maybe you could help each other, both find that trust, and look into some curiosities you both have that align. This, in particular, involving the rising oddness of shade creeper intrusions and alterations in recent months.\n\nFollowing some leads and one individual with a past with Gus , one of the two Green Seekers, you traveled towards the bottom of the Smolder Spire , within the mines there, at the very base. Asking around, discovered more connections to the Mahaan Treshi house , being involved in one of the subterranean mines. The Crownset Mines have been closed for months, and some strange goings-on in that space. Convincing, magically, the one manager , the one foreman who was watching over the closed mines, to allow you down the extensive subterranean shaft elevator that led you to where the mines were abandoned. You made enough noise to draw the attention of numerous shade creepers, some even further changed from the ones you had previously encountered. In this battle, you managed to slay many of these strange monstrous beasts, suffering a bit of rough and tumble first foray into these deep, deep mines below the city. And upon taking a moment to heal yourself, discovered what it seems to be is the partially healed, cocooned form of Lady Emoth Kade that you've been chasing.\n\nAs she began to emerge from this cocoon, awoken by some of these shade creepers that had escaped from death after seeing you entering their home, you plotted to wait as the invisible members of your team would travel outward. You would gather their attention with noise and the rest would swarm in and wipe out this cluster of creatures and Lady Emoth in one fell swoop. As you rushed through, in the midst of this plan you noticed that Lady Emoth Kade was not present. As you turned around the bend to the opening of another subterranean chamber, the rest of you managed to wipe out the majority of the creatures that remained, opening with a Fireball from Gus, and tactically and quickly dispatching of the creatures there, the few that remained alive in this central space, the loud explosive sound of the fireball and the combat sounds echoing throughout the nearby network of caves and tunnels. You step into this large chamber, here in the lightless depths of the mines.\n\nYou see unfolding before you small tables standing among scavenged equipment pieces where two figures stand hunched over cobbled devices and chunks of faintly glowing stone. Their faces are vacuous and stretched, like a long, hollowed swamp tree bowing under its own weight. A large, unfinished machine sits mostly between them, next to a pillar of broken rock. This room itself looking like a partially excavated and abandoned centerpiece of part of this mine. On the floor of the far wall, you see faint glitters in the very, very dull, barely there light, signs of coinage, and gems, residual wealth, like a hoard partially spent. Within it, an odd device, about two feet tall, that resembles a twisted orrery, a dull purple stone embedded in its center. Above that, these rocky outcroppings and abandoned mining platforms that rise among the sharp, stony walls, dozens of rising tunnels twist upward from the rising spire and vanish into it. Openings, like a magnificent sponge of rock, that continues to spread out into the city above.\n\nYou can see seemingly hundred of shredded husks that dangle from the walls in places, remnants of abandoned cocoons, their podlings long set free. Along this jagged expanse, a sprawling, flat, slug-like mass stretches across the far wall, nearly 50-60 feet across. You can just make out a few dozen opaque pods set beneath this slug mass, and you also watch as the mass tapers to one side, and there you see the spindly, monstrous, haunted tree-like body of the four-limbed creature, he matted black mane tangled and tumbling from her bony horned skull, black eyes peering soulless and predatory. There upon the rocky platform in the center, Lady Emoth stands, glancing up, arms open to this entity, calling to her \" mother \", before mentioning that there seems to be company, and looking back over her shoulder towards the hallway where your friends currently wait.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![The Shade Mother - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6d/The_Shade_Mother_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/375?cb=20220312180648)\n\nAs the slug creature slithers down from the wall and curls momentarily around a purple glowing crystal orrery, the back half of the slug mass sloughs off and remains on the wall. The creature, the Shade Mother , seeks the invisible Chetney , sensing his presence although not able to see him, and her voice enters his mind: \"Where are you? Come, prospective child. Welcome.\" Terrified, Chetney moves stealthily backward to rejoin the others and describes what he's seen. Gus suggests they snatch Lady Emoth and run, and Olly displays three small marble-like stones that she says can encapsulate an enemy and make them easily movable. She gives one each to Chetney and Imogen .\n\nAs the party enters the Shade Mother's chamber, she activates five brumestones embedded into devices along her body and lifts into the air, approaching slowly. Fearne spots shade creepers emerging from tunnels, and sees what might be Lady Emoth on the back wall. Gus then kicks off the battle with a Fireball and the fight begins. Because it is dark and she can't see, Fearne cast Daylight above Mother, which causes the shade creepers, Mother, and the until-now hidden Emoth to screech and shrink back from the sudden bright light.\n\nThe creatures within the daylight fight at disadvantage, but Mother has legendary resistances and attacks, and a lair action that summons more shade creepers each round. Chetney notices Emoth run into cover, approaches invisibly, and hits her with one of Olly's beads, imprisoning her in an impermeable bubble-like orb. He then assumes his werewolf form. Meanwhile, the others battle both Mother and the shade creepers she summons into the fight. Mother's poison attacks force those affected to fight at disadvantage, and she can also force them to attack their allies.\n\n![The Battle against the Shade Mother - Francis Lim](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3c/The_Battle_against_the_Shade_Mother_-_Francis_Lim.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/290?cb=20220316234348)\n\nAs always, the shade creepers are easy to kill but hit hard, and two more appear each round to join the battle. However, the party is able to gradually move the orb holding Emoth toward the exit. Fresh Cut Grass pulls a lever within the room, setting off an augur which collapses the central rock pillar and damages Chetney, but Chetney is able to crawl out from underneath it. Imogen moves to the orrery and manages to pull the purple crystal out of its center, then Misty Steps to the exit near the sphere. Orym uses the Rope of Climbing to pull the Shade Mother's tail into the grinding gears of the mine augur, holding her there and severely limiting her ability to attack.\n\nFearne leaps on top of the sphere and gets it rolling well down the exit tunnel as the rest of the party gradually moves there as well, taking potshots at the creatures and receiving some damage as they go. Eventually, they all reach the safety of the exit tunnel, pushing the sphere holding Emoth before them as they run.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nAs they approach the elevator to the surface, two more shade creepers leap out of the darkness but are quickly dispatched by Orym and Chetney. However, many more are swarming, called by the screeches of the bound Shade Mother. Ashton dispatches one, but Laudna is wounded. Imogen wounds another, which is then rolled over by Fearne, still atop the sphere, and Orym finishes it off with a thrown dagger. Laudna kills one but takes a critical hit from another and has to use Strength of the Grave to remain conscious at one hit point.\n\nFearne rolls the sphere into the elevator and the others crowd in atop and around it as it slowly rises with two quickly-killed shade creepers still hanging off the bottom. When they reach the top, Gus and Olly tell the party that they will take the encapsulated and feral Lady Emoth to their employer to prove that nefarious political figures have been attempting to frame Bells Hells. Imogen uses Detect Thoughts on Lady Emoth to read her venomous rage, then dives deeper to reach her more human thoughts focused on Mother: \"She will be free. She will be out. The night will come and all will join her and we will stop them. They will pay.\" Gus and Olly then share that their employer is Mistress Seshadri before leaving, rolling the arcane orb holding Emoth before them.\n\nMost of the party is wounded; Laudna is almost unconscious, and F.C.G. can't speak without glitching. They head to the Soot and Swill tavern where they rent rooms for the night, eat, drink, and encounter an awkward Pretty . Fearne uses the sending stone to check in with Dorian , who is safe. Chetney invites Fearne to join him in his room, and she tells him if he howls exactly at 3:00 AM, she'll be there.\n\nOrym goes to Ashton and F.C.G.'s room, soon joined by Imogen. They are concerned that F.C.G. is worrying about everyone but himself, and urge him to take more care of himself. Imogen shows them the purple crystal she took from the orrery in the lair, but F.C.G. doesn't have enough magic left to Identify it.\n\nAshton goes to Laudna and tries to reassure her that her relative lack of success in the battle wasn't her fault. She wasn't doing anything wrong—it's just bad luck. Fearne checks in with F.C.G., and the group tries to explain to them what sleep is. She then knocks on Chetney's door to make sure he isn't dead, startling him into a howl because he thinks he's missed their 3:00 AM rendezvous. Anxiously, he tries unsuccessfully to arrange for a wake-up call but ends up sleeping through the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen takes out the crystal and concentrates on it, feeling her essence pulled into it slightly. There is something about it that seems not to want to let go, something unnatural that wants to take her and make her something better. She, Fearne, and Laudna theorize that it might be what transformed the Shade Mother into her current horrific form or that their having taken it might prevent the mother from transforming anyone else. They also cover it with a blanket in the concern that it might call to the shade creepers.\n\nWhen everyone else is asleep, Imogen takes the crystal into a corner and opens her mind to it in a last attempt to identify it. She recalls that the design of the device she ripped it out of was similar to those in the Nightmare King 's laboratory. She can sense strange, twisting fey magic within it that takes and changes. It is alluring, warm, comforting, and welcoming. She drifts into sleep cradling it to herself, losing herself to the warmth and the draw.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e16-the_shade_mother"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E18-A Hungry Jungle","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells , following a handful of threads that led them away from the city of Jrusar and northward through the jungles to the Heartmoor , the swampy bog region of the northern part of the Oderan Wilds where the Heartmoor Hamlet exists. There, you had hoped to, one, find information that seemed to pertain to the death of the Lumas twins in the path of your particular interest, as well as deal with a possible job set by Jiana Hexum that could cancel some of your outstanding debt and issues that you carry as baggage, Ashton .\n\nGathering your materials, purchasing some horses, and trudging on for a handful of days, keeping predominantly to the roads through the jungle, you had a handful of odd encounters with some creatures in the vicinity, some errant weather effects, gathered a couple of small magical items through some careful planning, some careful reflexes, and pursuits, and some relatively uneventful evenings of camping off the road where some conversations were had, some bonding was mounted.\n\n![The fairy - Qelric](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5c/The_fairy_-_Qelric.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220404020610)\n\nThen, about a day out from the Heartmoor in the middle of the night, something seemed to be glowing in the nearby jungle, near the ridge of where you had set up camp: a strange little faintly glimmering fairy, a small tiny creature that led some of you curiously to look in its direction, Fearne specifically pursuing it out of frustration. But this seemed to not really be a fairy, as instead the presence of it drew you mindlessly forward into the darkness. Ashton, you were quick to follow and find Fearne staring stunned, mindless, into the darkness.  There, this fairy creature was tethered to this long, winding vine that seemed to be protruding from, up until this point, a well-hidden gargantuan fanged plant creature , that began to rise out of the brush and shadow before opening its large mouth.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nRoll initiative!\n\nPart of the party is still asleep as the encounter with the fairy-lure mantrap begins. Fearne shrugs off the  mantrap's charm and wakes Chetney , Orym , and Fresh Cut Grass with a yell. Ashton falls under its effect, moves towards it and is swallowed, taking serious acid damage on each turn thereafter. Chetney takes his werewolf form and Orym's Goading Attack gives the  mantrap disadvantage on attacks against anyone but him.\n\n![Imogen twinning her Catapult spell - Shrugs](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/62/Imogen_twinning_her_Catapult_spell_-_Shrugs.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220328202912)\n\nOnce swallowed by the  mantrap, a party member can escape with a contested strength check or if the tree is damaged enough on a single attack turn to make it throw up. Ashton punches a hole through its esophagus with the bottom of their hammer and crawls through on a successful strength check. Laudna then gives the  mantrap disadvantage on strength checks with Hex. Imogen attacks with a twinned Catapult spell and taps into a wild magic surge, which turns her skin dark blue.\n\n![False Fairy Vine - Awefull Archives](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6e/False_Fairy_Vine_-_Awefull_Archives.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220406172804)\n\nThe  mantrap charms FCG and Laudna into moving toward it, and they discover it is vulnerable to fire damage and has legendary actions. The plant swallows Laudna, causing her Hex to vanish. The acid damage knocks her unconscious, but her ability to Cling to Life brings her back. She then crawls out through the hole Ashton hacked through the  mantrap. The mantrap swallows FCG but Chetney damages it enough to make it throw him up. FCG then gets the How do you want to do this? with his saw blade arm.\n\nImogen is still a vibrant dark blue, and the party decides to see if finishing their interrupted long rest will cure her. They wake late in the morning to find her color unchanged. While they prepare to get back on the road again, Chetney pokes a fungal growth and releases a small cloud of poisonous spores. Imogen discovers a pre- Calamity long-ruined structure which Orym recognizes as old elvish architecture. He remembers that during the Calamity, there were \"climactic elements\" that took place in Marquet , scarring the landscape heavily and creating the Rumedam Desert from what had formerly been lush jungle holding a flourishing elf and orcish city.\n\nThey gather their supplies and ride on northward toward Heartmoor Hamlet .\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![The other adventuring party - Timo Fluit](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAs the party continues their journey, they reach an established camping area where a group of five figures with horses are packing up: a hairless male katari , a human female with a drum, a small male goblin , a tall female firbolg named Tejana , and Hutchin , a slender female silver-scaled dragonborn . FCG casts Detect Thoughts on the dragonborn, but she notices him performing magic and becomes suspicious. The travelers are going the same direction as Bells Hells , toward the Heartmoor Hamlet , and Orym asks if they'd like to travel together. They cautiously agree to go in tandem. Fearne asks if they have anything fun for sale, and they offer a bracelet which Ashton buys.\n\nThey travel on for several hours into a swampy bogland and eventually see the small walled town of Heartmoor Hamlet in the distance, past a bridge arching over a channel of water. They enter through the Southern Gate Ridge which is guarded by two wilders . One of them directs the group to a stable for their horses and an inn for themselves, where they rent rooms. The innkeeper, Dobby Kingsman, tells them a little about the town and the locations of the Twilight Mirror Museum and Mosslight Manor (the home of Estani , the astronomist who worked with the Lumas twins before their deaths).\n\nThough Orym and Imogen are eager to talk to Estani, they agree to go to the museum first. The museum is an unusual curved three-story building on the main square, surrounded by a tall iron fence. When they ring the bell at the gate, a face peers through the curtains at them, and shortly thereafter Evon Hytroga appears and welcomes them, offering them a half-day pass to the museum. He is amused when Ashton tells him they were sent by Jiana Hexum , immediately withdrawing the offer of a tour. The rival party who will be competing against them to complete the heist have not arrived yet, but are expected any minute. Once they arrive, Evon will notify Bells Hells and the competition will begin at midnight the next day. Evon also mentions to Ashton that he'd heard that during Jiana's recent break-in, one of the burglars suffered a serious head injury.\n\nThey then head to Estani's home, Mosslight Manor, which is a little ramshackle but cozy. Imogen is very nervous, hoping that Estani has the ripped-out book pages that talk about her mother. [1] The door to the manor bears recently installed locks, and when the owner peers out cautiously, they can see Estani is very old and of mixed elf-orc descent. Orym explains they are here at the behest of Oshad Breshio , and Estani sadly welcomes them into the organized and book-filled chaos of his home.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e18-a_hungry_jungle"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E21-Fight at the Museum","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo last we left off, Bells Hells had made their way northward in the Oderan Wilds towards the Heartmoor , the marsh region of the north side of this region in Marquet , and the Heartmoor Hamlet , the city that is built in the center of this space. Upon meeting some individuals, getting some information about the red moon Ruidus and some unique elements of Imogen 's nightmares that may have some connection, you gathered some materials and you met up with Evon Hytroga . You were sent here by Jiana Hexum to be one of two different burglar teams, to be competing to break in and acquire a specific artifact that was named by Hytroga, specifically, one that's called \"Wind Folly\", the earring of Harudan .\n\nYou then traversed the first floor of this place, fell in some traps, managed to leave some traps for your friends, leave some traps for the enemies, scattered yourself a bit. Didn't do much exploring upstairs, but managed to find one path down into the first basement where the true museum begins. There were more traps, there were more dangers, there were unexpected shortfalls, there were battles with marionettes , and all the time being chased by this other troupe of burglars . You managed to leave them behind, beating at a door that is currently being held by an immovable rod while you went into this second basement.\n\nHere, more traps, more dangers. It's been great! Before eventually coming to this central chamber, which does contain the artifact you seek. It is currently encased in a very thick glass enclosure, and after a few impacts, you're managing to do some physical damage to it. You're seeing it cracking. At about the same time that these attacks began, these two vacant spaces that looked vaguely humanoid in the two stone walls to the sides of you, these large, almost reverse space art pieces began to fill with a dark clay, and then eventually, rapidly, they seemed to fill into a humanoid shape, burning red eyes peering from within their clay musculature as they step out and pincer the group ahead.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nRoll initiative!\n\n![Imogen casting Command - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/18/Imogen_casting_Command_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220425170152)\n\nImogen Commands both clay wardens to \"grovel\" on their turn, while Orym again attacks the glass case with his sword, doing slightly more damage. Laudna then holds her rock chisel in place at the enclosure for Ashton to whack with his hammer, cracking the glass significantly. When Laudna moves away, however, the constructs use their reactions to hit her, knocking her unconscious into a corner. Fearne casts Cure Wounds to bring her back and then summons Little Mister . Chetney completely shatters the glass case with his chisel, snatches the earring, and sprints for the door they entered through.\n\nOn their turn, the clay wardens follow Imogen's previous Command and fall prone. The party all run toward the door, doing what damage they can to the constructs on the way, but Ashton discovers the door outward is jammed shut, and Chetney realizes The Verdict has taken the immovable rod they left behind earlier in the museum and used it to wedge the door closed. They all immediately reverse course back into the room holding the wardens and toward the second door leading outward from it into a twin to the lion statue room they entered through.\n\nFearne gets the final blow on one of the wardens with Scorching Ray and uses Little Mister's fiery teleportation ability to move Laudna slightly away and nearer the other exit. Laudna passes her bag of magnets to Chetney who passes them and the earring to FCG , and FCG uses the magnets to hide the earring inside his mouth. The remaining clay warden picks up Orym and throws him at Imogen, damaging both, and only FCG's intervention saves Imogen from unconsciousness. Orym then gets the How do you want to do this? on the final creature.\n\nEveryone is damaged, several of them severely. While Chetney determines which of the floor tiles are trapped in the twin lion-statue room and FCG casts Aura of Vitality on the party, they discuss possible strategies, including luring The Verdict by playing dead and substituting a fake earring. Laudna badly crafts a fake which they insert into Imogen's music box and leave on Wind Folly's former pedestal. Eventually they decide to try for a short rest, while Imogen remains on guard against entry by The Verdict from either side, ready to telepathically trigger the floor tile traps with ball bearings if The Verdict moves into the lion rooms.\n\nOnly a few minutes in, they hear The Verdict entering one of the adjacent rooms and identifying the trapped tiles. As the rival party moves forward and begins trying to open the door leading to where Bells Hells are, Imogen telepathically drops a ball bearing on one of the tiles, triggering a blast of flame from the mouth of the lion statue. Chetney and Ashton are able to hold the door closed, trapping The Verdict in the lion room as Imogen sets off the flames again. The party hears screams and a voice crying, \"Severo is down!\" and when they hear Severo being moved out of the room, Imogen triggers the flames a third time.\n\n![Chetney carrying FCG in the lion room - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/e3/Chetney_carrying_FCG_in_the_lion_room_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220425170908)\n\nWhen Orym cautiously investigates the now-charred room, there is silence and drag marks leading outward. The next room is also deserted, but in the central chamber the group finds, charred and unconscious, Hutchin and Severo the goblin, with Tejana standing over them. FCG casts Spare the Dying on both and Fearne heals Hutchin. They discover the other two members of The Verdict hiding with crossbows, but convince them to stand down. Orym recovers the immovable rod. Laudna convinces Chetney to steal the alleged \"Journal of Vespin Chloras \" as they leave, apparently unnoticed by The Verdict.\n\nBells Hells moves back upstairs. On the way, Ashton takes the helmet from the strangely familiar suit of Hishari armor. Angry at the level of danger they've encountered, Ashton wants to take further retribution on Evon Hytroga before leaving, and the party moves to the second floor where they locate and steal some hidden papers and a pair of glasses in a locked drawer. Satisfied, the group moves back downstairs and exits through the kitchen door.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Bells Hells after the fight - Elaine Tipping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOnce outside, Chetney drops his werewolf form. Surrounded by guards, Evon Hytroga is waiting, and FCG presents the earring to him. Evon congratulates the group and tells them he will notify Jiana Hexum of their victory. As a reward, he takes out and holds up a mirror-like object toward them, then takes them inside to show them the portrait of them it has created, which will hang proudly on the wall as the first victors of what he is thinking of making an annual contest.\n\nThe group is worried about returning to their hotel, and travel out of town to sleep in the woods. After a long rest, Fresh Cut Grass casts Remove Curse on Imogen , removing her blue coloration. As the spell fades, he also casts Detect Thoughts in an attempt to dive deeper into her mind, but she shuts him out and tells him not to try it again. He notices, however, her hand move toward the shard of Gnarlrock in her pocket.\n\nFCG Identifies the stolen glasses as being Eyes of Charming , able to cast Charm on those they look upon. While FCG can't use Identify again that day, Ashton determines that the stolen papers (all apparently blank) are magical because they can't be torn. Imogen sends a message to Jiana Hexum , telling her of the party's victory in the heist, while Chetney determines that the \"Journal of Vespin Chloras \" is a fake.\n\nBefore they leave town, Chetney wants to stop by Knot Forgotten and talk to the toymaker Zadro Ichlen , so he and Orym go there. Chetney is impressed with the workmanship on display and learns that Zadro learned her trade in Uthodurn . When Chetney asks her if she knew Oltgar , her entire demeanor changes, becoming hostile and suspicious. Even when Chetney tells her he has no love for Oltgar, she remains wary and they agree to forget they ever met. Chetney's anger seems to almost overpower him inside the shop, and when Orym questions him outside, Chetney tells him Oltgar is \"the worst kind of person.\"\n\nOn the way back, they run into Roe Estani leaving the inn, who tells them that through the years, he's had friends with similar interests as the Lumas twins . The friends called themselves the Grim Verity , a hundred-year-old collective of collegiate scholars \"uncovering conspiratorial secrets of history to a borderline blasphemous degree by theological standards.\" The twins were members. If Bells Hells go to the Aydinlan Seminary in Yios , they should find Ebenold Kai and deliver to her a sealed letter which he gives to Orym.\n\nOrym and Chetney rejoin the group, who have reclaimed the horses and settled up at the inn. They mount up and travel uneventfully to Jrusar , along the way learning that the papers stolen from Evon become readable in extreme cold, which Laudna provides with a Ray of Frost . The papers are mostly to do with Evon's acquisition of artifacts from around the world. A recurring name is SP.Y.SH-N, which Orym recognizes as referring to Spireling Shenn (a leader in the Emon sect of the Clasp ). There is also a letter concerning Jiana Hexum's transactions with dealers in Wildemount : three separate shipments of 3'x1'x1' crates which she immediately sent onward. Ashton saw a similar crate on his last job with the Nobodies and remembers pulling something from it, but his memories of that night are very hazy. The other papers establish that the relics in the museum are fakes commissioned by Hytroga. Ashton gives Imogen the papers concerning the crates to hold and slips Fearne the stolen Eyes of Charming .\n\nAfter four days on the road, they see the flame of the Lantern Spire and reach Jrusar just after sunset.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e21-fight_at_the_museum"}

Upon arriving, you've gotten some interesting revelations through meeting a new friend , who themselves have lost some of their memory but have unique ties to the past of Fearne Calloway . Fearne, in reaching out to your mother , realizing that they're not that far away. In fact, should be coming to Bassuras fairly soon.\n\nUpon trying to find a way into or decide how to get towards Armand Treshi, who is currently confirmed to be held within the Seat of Disdain by the Paragon's Call faction of Crawler gangs , you have plotted some possibilities. In preparation for one of these possibilities, the event known as the Deathwish Run , the terrifying deadly race that is utilized as a means of celebration or conflict management, or just searching for glory or death within this city, could be a means of getting in with the faction of the Paragon's Call and get closer to your goal.\n\nYou went and spoke with the resident chief engineer, Imahara Joe , who apparently does a lot of the repairs and construction of the automatons and the crawler machines throughout the city and beyond. Through this conversation, one, began to commission one of these skirmish-crawlers to be utilized in such an event, with the possible lien that if you appease one of the factions, or at least beseech them for membership and this is your test, they might give you a loaner or two with an emblem that they would give to you. Imahara Joe also took a glance over here at FCG and seemed to be quite entranced by the history that you might not have been aware of, the seeming possibility that you were not built by Dancer , but indeed may have been something much older .\n\nSpeaking of Dancer, also, found out that Dancer is still alive and had passed through town a short time ago. But, as we finished up, with a lot of these events stacking around the corner, you all decided to find a new place to sleep, given that the previous one was found after you were followed by the Paragon's Call, and began making your path towards The Undercarriage.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party arrives at The Undercarriage and rents rooms for the night, where they go over their plans again, trying to determine who is least likely to be recognized by Armand Treshi as having been at the ball in Jrusar and involved in the theft of his ring. They also inspect the postcards that Fearne received through the years, allegedly from her parents , and Chetney notices they are handmade and not at all worn, although they are about ninety years old and Fearne reads them regularly. Fearne accepts the possibility that they may have been written by her grandmother rather than her parents, although she is very confused.\n\n![Laudna and Imogen making up - cvleart](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b5/Laudna_and_Imogen_making_up_-_cvleart.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220718021833)\n\nBefore bed, Imogen uses the pencil Laudna gave her to write a note: \"Can we talk?\" in Laudna's notebook. Dusk waylays Laudna first to ask her out to dinner, but Laudna nervously puts her off and leaves. Imogen is waiting for her in the hallway, and they both apologize, saying they don't want to fight anymore. Imogen gives Laudna the ruby ring she purchased the day before, and Laudna shares with her that Dusk asked her out and she's confused. Imogen tells her about her latest dream, and that the figure had spoken to her this time. When she woke up, Ruidus was flaring. They decide to try falling asleep holding hands to see if Laudna can join her in the next dream. They also decide to pretend to still be fighting so that FCG can participate in patching up their relationship.\n\nThey join the others, feigning an argument, and Imogen asks FCG to help them, but the plan backfires when FCG only feels more guilt about not having been there when needed. His speech is glitching and he refers repeatedly to past events and people as still happening-- he seems very confused. Imogen point-blank asks if he wants to find Dancer , and he does, but he's very worried about why she left him and who and what he really is. Imogen promises the party will help him find Dancer, but Laudna says he should be prepared to find she isn't fully who he thought she was. FCG's mental confusion seems only to increase when he tries to describe Dancer, and they agree maybe he needs rest. Laudna and Imogen quickly pretend to make up and thank him for helping them.\n\n![Dusk and Orym sparring - Houda Belgharbi](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/c0/Dusk_and_Orym_sparring_-_Houda_Belgharbi.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220718031824)\n\nMeanwhile, Orym tells Dusk he's never seen fighting technique such as she employs, and asks her to spar with the wooden toy swords he bought earlier, first to score five hits wins. They battle, each disarming the other and then recovering, but Orym wins. He thinks her fighting style is fey , and she asks him for some pointers. How about tonight? Embarrassed, he tells her it's complicated, and he only likes guys, but she can keep the sword.\n\nThe party moves to their rooms. Imogen asks Fearne and Chetney, who are taking first watch, to keep a close eye on FCG. Ashton tells FCG that if anyone makes FCG feel bad, Ashton will kill them. While the others sleep, Chetney shows Fearne the progress on the music box he's carving for her parents and asks if she has paint or ink to fill in the indentations, but Fearne doesn't. He tells her it's okay if she wants to tell them anything, and she produces a small grape-sized green gem that her nana told her was very important to give to her parents when she saw them because it would help them. It has grooves along the side that appear to be designed to carry some sort of enchantment. Chetney gives Fearne her hand-carved gift: a small wooden wolf.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nIn the morning, the party heads to Esmer 's shop and picks up the wall-breaking explosive, after having an arcane timer added to its fuse. Esmer asks them, if they come across Dancer , to tell her Esmer says \"Hi.\" Imogen asks her to describe Dancer. She had dark black hair, olive skin \"with a bit of fuzz fur on the edges\", and a tattoo of a star on her right cheek.\n\nThey all head to the Seat of Disdain , the fortress of Paragon's Call . Orym , Imogen, and FCG hide themselves in a deserted building within eyeshot of the citadel. Fearne turns into a rat and scurries into Dusk 's pocket, and they and the others are admitted to the Seat, where General Ratanish comes out to meet them, greeting Ashton in a friendly way. He buys Ashton's story of being in town and looking for casual work. Ashton tells Ratanish they were surprised the Call has expanded out of Bassuras , and Ratanish replies that \"Otohan\" has changed the way Paragon's Call does business for the better. However, Ratanish doesn't decide who to hire. He will bring out the person who does.\n\nHe goes inside and returns with a lithe woman with short grey hair (strongly resembling the woman from Imogen's dream two nights prior) [1] . This is Otohan Thull , and Ashton is awestruck to be meeting such a famous figure. Otohan asks what the party can do for them, and when Ashton rattles off a list, they are told that Paragon's Call doesn't hire just anyone. They must prove themselves. They can do this either by fighting, or by participating in the Deathwish Run .\n\nAshton, as a local kid, chooses the race, and Otohan sets the time for dusk that evening. Paragon's Call will provide them an emblem for one vehicle. As Otohan turns to leave, Fearne (in rat form) discreetly runs up Otohan's back and under her cloak, finding a very small metallic backpack-like contraption with two cavities in its middle holding two crystal or glass containers. As she drops back down to the ground, Ratanish notices her and approaches, but Dusk scoops her up, calling her \"Poots\", and they're allowed to leave.\n\nThey meet up with the others and tell them what's happened, and that they will now have two vehicles. Ashton and Laudna head to All-Minds-Burn where they meet with Justi Pross . She agrees to help them sabotage the other contenders in the Deathwish, and gives them two improvised flags with which to mark their vehicles. She also gives Laudna a small packet containing some of the group's drugs.\n\n![Imahara Joe and FCG - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/bf/Imahara_Joe_and_FCG_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20220718022506)\n\nThe rest of the group goes to Imahara Joe 's to tell him they now need two vehicles instead of just the one. He shows them how to drive them. When they leave, they decide Chetney and Ashton will drive, and Laudna and Imogen will ride shotgun respectively. Orym and Dusk will try to jump on a competitor's vehicle in The Skids and take it over, while Fearne performs creative sabotage along the way.\n\nThey return to Joe's where both their vehicles are ready. People are beginning to gather along the race route, and when they reach its starting line, there are four other skirmishers ready to compete.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e27-a_race_for_the_prize"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E29-Dark Portents","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells in the city of Bassuras in the Hellcatch Valley have been chasing down the individual known as Armand Treshi , who escaped from Jrusar after being tied into some very dark stuff.\n\nYou managed to uncover the fact that he was currently held in the Seat of Disdain . under guard of the Paragon's Call . Upon confirming his location there and putting it into your plans, you also discovered that Birdie Calloway , the mother of Fearne , was also travelling to town, and has been doing so for some business for some time. Along this way, you encountered an individual named Dusk who had an amnesiac history that seemed to tie with the Calloway parents as well. This chance meeting meant some interesting bonding, some tension, some awkwardness, but nevertheless, briefly inviting this bright-eyed individual into your found family for a time. Upon growing close to uncovering the means of getting to Treshi by entering the Deathwish Run , an extremely dangerous, deadly, and really fun race through all manner of streets and terrain around the city of Bassuras, you succeeded in doing so and made your approval entry into the Paragon's Call to pursue this thread.\n\nThe next day, upon traversing to Imahara Joe 's place to turn in your loaner crawler , as well as possibly looking to get the other one repaired, you watched as a skirmisher-crawler rode up with Birdie Calloway in tow. As she stepped into the shop, eventually Fearne and the rest of the group began to approach, in which you had a sudden reunion with Birdie, then also noticed that Dusk was unfamiliar to your mother. At which point, Dusk reached out and grabbed both of your arms, and revealed that the form you know as Dusk to perhaps not have been the true form that you expected. Instead, seeing behind a somewhat opalescent, multi-colored skin upon pale white hair and dark, dark attire.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![The standoff with Yu - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a4/The_standoff_with_Yu_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20220810134522)\n\nFearne is terribly confused by Dusk 's transformation and Birdie 's obvious fear. Dusk apologizes for lying to her and asks Birdie if she wants to tell Fearne the truth, but Birdie only urges Fearne to leave and not get involved. Dusk points out that although they've had plenty of opportunities to harm Fearne and the party, they haven't. Birdie casts a spell and vanishes, but is unable to pull out of Dusk's grasp, and Orym immediately moves up behind Dusk and presses his sword into the small of their back.\n\nDusk tells Fearne her parents are charlatans and grifters from the Seelie Court and stole a precious artifact from the Unseelie Court . Birdie admits what they took wasn't theirs, but didn't belong to the Unseelie either and was better in their hands being used for a good goal. Dusk transforms into \"the hottest half-elf man that you have ever seen\" and tells Orym the invitation is still open, but Orym stabs them in the back until they let go of Fearne's hand. They introduce themself: Yu Suffiad . During the distraction, Birdie breaks free but Imogen and Ashton guard the exits. Both Birdie and Yu repeat that they have not lied to Fearne, before Birdie also stabs Yu. Imogen Commands Yu not to attack and the rest of the party, unsure at this point whom to believe, attempt to calm matters. Orym succeeds in disarming Yu.\n\n![Dusk and Fearne - Kaitlyn Leeds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/ad/Dusk_and_Fearne_-_Kaitlyn_Leeds.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220808130459)\n\nBirdie explains that Fearne was born in Exandria under a flare of the red moon, Ruidus , before her parents took her back into the Feywild . Ever since, Ruidus has appeared in the Feywild where it never existed previously. Fearne then attempts to stab Yu, but misses, and a fight begins . Yu continues to assert that they didn't lie to Fearne and could have attacked or killed the party at any time, but didn't. If the group kills Yu, they won't get answers, and more assassins will keep attacking them. They will have to fight every member of the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, and the Keeper of the Moontides .\n\nImogen then casts Detect Thoughts on Birdie, diving deeply, and Laura gets an exceptionally long and detailed whisper. Imogen urges Yu and the group to stop fighting and talk. Fresh Cut Grass casts a healing spell on Yu while Ashton grapples Birdie. Orym attempts to use the remaining Bead of Imprisonment [1] on Yu but fails, destroying the bead. Chetney intimidates Birdie into standing down for the moment, and Imogen tells Birdie she knows she's trying to do the right thing, but she looks like the bad guy here. How does Birdie know the Nightmare King ?\n\nBirdie explains that although Ira has done bad things in the past, he's the only person who could help them. Although the fey are beings based on whim, this is bigger than all of them. She will explain more if they promise not to allow Yu to tell \"the rest of her kind\" what they're working on. Normally, only Catha appears in the Feywild and Ruidus is not present. But seven or so years ago Ruidus \"began poking through,\" offering odd boons the Unseelie were eager to utilize. The Unseelie began working with unnamed Exandrians to build a device that would increase the new \"boons\" from Ruidus. Because Oleander Calloway had had visions of the red moon tearing through the Feywild leaving devastation in its path with Fearne in its center, the Calloways tried to warn against this, but were not believed. The Calloways eventually stole the Moontide Crown to prevent the device's completion. They left Fearne behind to protect her, and Fearne is now apparently significantly older than her mother. They began working with the Nightmare King in an attempt to build an arcane construct utilizing the Crown to combat the danger of Ruidus.\n\nYu shows them a hand mirror created by Ira, which holds corrupted shadow assassins that target a person the mirror is activated and pointed at. She has not used it, but any subsequent assassins won't have such qualms.\n\nLaudna tells Birdie that Ira was killing children, but Birdie didn't know and is sure he was only doing it at someone else's behest. They were all trying to raise money for their project to build a device to discern the true nature of Ruidus \"and why everything's overlapping.\" They have about a month until the 21st to the 23rd of Fessuran , when there will be an apogee solstice . Morri Calloway was making them one of the things Ira needed to finish the device, but Hondir will have to explain further. He's a scientist living with members of Grim Verity . Whatever it was, it should be being sent along shortly.\n\nYu says the only thing that will stop the Court sending more assassins is the return of the crown and the death of the Calloways. Birdie notes that at least they don't know about Fearne, but Yu admits she told them. She was just doing her job.\n\nFearne offers that if the Court will give her parents a month, she'll go with Yu back to the Feywild, but is talked out of it by the others. Yu counteroffers that she will protect Fearne from the Courts, but Fearne feels safer with Bells Hells . Birdie reveals that Morri isn't an actual blood relative, but just a close family friend, although Fearne believed she was her grandmother. When Yu mentions the Gnarlrock , Imogen Commands her to stop talking but fails, and tells Laudna telepathically that Delilah Briarwood is listening to this conversation.\n\nFearne remembers that Morri had given her a small green gem to give to her parents when she found them, which FCG Identifies as a Weave Lens allowing someone looking through it to see the patterns of magical energy in the room and the runic languages they contain.\n\nAfter much discussion, the group decides that if Yu will give them a month, the Calloways will return the Crown and accompany Yu back to the Feywild . After some thought, Yu agrees. As Yu readies to leave, Orym uses their sword to slash their sleeves before returning it to them, and Birdie holds the door, slamming it once Yu is gone.\n\nBirdie collapses, apologizing. Fearne's father Oleander Calloway is in their hideout about 45 miles east of the city, and she needs to get back there, but first she needs to speak to Hondir , who is in Bassuras. They exchange introductions and Birdie also apologizes to Imahara Joe and passes him some coin. He gives her a heavy satchel containing glowing blue items, presumably power sources. Joe also can get the party's crawler repaired in a few hours for 110 gold, which Birdie pays. She reveals she pickpocketed from Yu the ring that tracks Fearne. They cautiously head out the door toward Hondir.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Hondir - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/98/Hondir_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220809022849)\n\nBirdie leads the way while they talk. At their out-of-town hideout, the team is her, Oleander , and Ira , but they get advice from Hondir in Bassuras occasionally, who is doing similar research and has a much larger network of individuals. He's recently gotten into some trouble and is laying low in an underground hideout near one of the city cisterns, and is initially very suspicious but eventually admits the party to his well-booby-trapped room.\n\nBirdie and Hondir explain that the ley lines crossing Exandria seem to be shifting, a sign of an impending, incredibly powerful Apogee Solstice . The solstices strengthen the nexuses of the ley lines even further than normal, and the recent shifts indicate the upcoming solstice will be focused on Marquet , with three possible nexuses: the Panagrip Sands , the ocean north of the Oderan Wilds , and the Hellcatch Valley . However, the researchers had found themselves getting their funding pulled, their departments closed, and being told to walk away from the research. While they'd continued privately, anyone connected to the work has either gone missing or dead.\n\nOrym asks if Grim Verity means anything to him, and it does. He is one of its members, and he knew the Lumas twins . He also is familiar with the Gray Assassins sent to kill them, who have removed at least half of their members. Orym is sure these are the same assassins responsible for the attack on Keyleth that he is investigating, but Hondir cannot suggest why she was attacked.\n\nBirdie is involved in this because the Calloways came to Exandria's Prime Material Plane so that Fearne would be born in the Verdant Expanse of Tal'Dorei . The night of her birth, Ruidus flared. Since the red moon did not exist in the Feywild , they learned what they could of it and those born under it. Oleander then had a vision of the moon following them, and its redness eating away at the Feywild . Ruidus suddenly began appearing in the Fey, briefly at first, but the Calloways discovered that Unseelie magic was being used to keep others from paying attention to it, and that the Court was meeting with Exandrians to design a machine focused on Ruidus for an unknown purpose. The Calloways took its shiniest piece, the Moontide Crown , to disable it, and were now, with Ira, attempting to build a machine which Ira told them would gather information about the red moon.\n\nImogen asks about the meeting the Calloways overheard. Was one of the participants Otohan Thull ? Birdie recognizes her as one of two Exandrians involved; the other was an older male elf. They share she is in Bassuras running Paragon's Call and Imogen describes her dreams.\n\nHondir hesitantly tells them that a Grim Verity member in Vasselheim discovered ancient texts beneath the temple of Erathis from as far back as The Founding , thus drawing the ire of the powerful temples there. These texts seemed to indicate that Ruidus did not always exist but came later, and further referred to two gods that don't exist in the Pantheon and have been forgotten. Grim Verity theorizes the appearance of Ruidus is connected to the disappearance of the gods. These ancient texts are currently secretly with Grim Verity members in Yios .\n\nAshton asks if other planes of existence are also having issues with Ruidus. Hondir replies that another Grim Verity member, Planerider Ryn , specializes in crossing between the various planes and might know more.\n\nWhen Imogen asks if Hondir knows her mother Liliana Temult , he knows her from about twelve years ago at the Yios Seminary. She was one of the volunteers for their Ruidusborn study, one of the incredibly gifted who could affect the world around them. Imogen telekinetically picks up a bottle, and Hondir confirms it's the same gift as her mother had.\n\nBirdie explains that Morri helped raise her, as well as Fearne. Morri's \"fane is her domain, and she can tweak and stretch things out as she wills.\" It's possible this explains why Birdie was gone for six years, but Fearne experienced it as over a century. Fearne thinks that Morri probably made the postcards that were supposed to come from her parents.\n\nHondir asks if he can come with them when they leave, since he now feels compromised in Bassuras, and they agree. They decide to pick up their repaired crawler and meet back up at A Taste of Tal'Dorei . Hondir starts packing. When Birdie and Fearne hug goodbye, they mutually pick each other's pockets but return their takings.\n\nThey discuss the fact that they were supposed to meet with Paragon's Call and move in there today, and decide to make a day trip out of the travel to see Oleander and Ira's device first. Stopping at Imahara Joe's, they have him attach a rickshaw-type contraption to its rear before heading to the restaurant and meeting Birdie. They roar off out the gates and out of town into the Hellcatch, before doubling back to get the momentarily forgotten Hondir.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e29-dark_portents"}

Along with Milo's aid, you seemed to ascertain some mysterious nature of the night in which you did fall from Jiana's manor, and took the crack on your head that has led to this strange new influx of abilities that you're still discovering and developing as you go.\n\nYou also began to go about the town and gather materials. You spoke with Eshteross and let him know what had been going on. He let you know that in the interim, while you were up in the Heartmoor on the north side of the Oderan Wilds , he was keeping tabs on Treshi , specifically Armand Treshi with the ring that you had placed upon his hand during the ball. It seemed that Armand had skipped town not but four days or so before you arrived. He fled to the southeastern direction and upon touching base with some of his connections in the more seedy parts of the city, got word that he seemed to be fleeing with most of his belongings - the important belongings at least - after clearing out much of his home, to the southeast into the Hellcatch Valley to the city of Bassuras .\n\nYou were then asked by Eshteross, with no necessary obligation to do so, if you'd be interested in seeing this through. You agreed to, and he gave you both the device that allows you, within a certain couple-mile radius, to track the direction of Armand Treshi from where you currently stand, and offered for quicker and safer travel to the city of Bassuras in the middle of the Hellcatch Valley, which the journey itself being somewhat dangerous on ground, access to his skyship , which is a little under a month away from its next required shipment. Also, you made him promise to give you some cookies before you left in the morning.\n\nAfter gathering some supplies, getting your things in order, going and talking to Marwa and making some purchases including one very chaotic portable hole which I am both excited and frightened as to what it will lead to down the road, but that's how you roll in D&D , you all went to spend your last evening in the city of Jrusar for the time being in the Spire by Fire in the Core Spire , the familiar space where you all sort of began this venture and met each other, getting a couple rooms and bedding down for the night.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Chetney in wolf form - Kaitlyn Leeds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/e1/Chetney_in_wolf_form_-_Kaitlyn_Leeds.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/140?cb=20220516003404)\n\nIn the middle of the night, Chetney sneaks out of the Spire by Fire Inn and breaks into the Prism Emporium via sliding down the chimney. He accosts and terrifies owner Tuyen Otwana about the prices of her wares, eventually transforming into his werewolf form to warn her to charge fairly from now on. He swipes her arm with his claw, exposing bone, and then cauterizes the wound with his flaming claws. Promising to return, he exits invisibly to return to the inn to sleep. [1]\n\nIn the morning, the party assigns Fearne to track the items put into their new portable hole . They experiment with the hole, discovering its properties. Orym gives Chetney the Horn of Silent Alarm , since Chetney frequently goes off alone to scout and otherwise. In return, Chetney gives Orym a gift: a wooden box carved with images of flowers and of the moons. They do a little shopping for general supplies and then go to the Eshteross estate, where they pick up their promised cookies and the enchanted bust. Eshteross requests that when they bring back Armand Treshi from Bassuras , hopefully he will be in one piece. Orym and Imogen thank Lord Eshteross for his help, telling him he is a good person.\n\nThe party makes their way to the Aerie Spire and the Silver Sun anchored there. First mate Khalil Benes takes them to Captain Xandis when they tell him they were sent by Lord Eshteross. Xandis is initially blunt: the party should do what they tell them to do and they won't throw them overboard. Overall, though, Xandis is affable and friendly, accepting one of Laudna 's ginger cookies happily. When Xandis asks who the leader of the group is, FCG volunteers Ashton . Xandis tells them they can go anywhere on the ship except the Captain's quarters. They'll leave as soon as Xandis finishes their sandwich.\n\nKhalil gives the party the basics of running the ship and its weaponry, and they meet the other members of the crew and find their rooms. As the ship pulls out of the skyport , Laudna and Imogen use Prestidigitation to create fireworks to either side, and the city of Jrusar shrinks below them as the ship rises and the sails fill.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Night on the Silver Sun - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/e0/Night_on_the_Silver_Sun_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20220515101012)\n\nThe Silver Sun travels over the jungles of the Serpentwind Peaks near the towns of Evishi and Troll Ferry . As the day progresses, the party catches sight of The Rift marking the border of the badlands of the Hellcatch Valley . Night eventually falls just as they cross The Rift. On deck, Imogen asks Ashton about his past in the region, and he tells her it is a bad place for people.\n\nIn the morning, they have left The Rift behind and see the Aggrad Mountains to the north cradling the city of King's Fall . Captain Xandis tells them the weather in this area can be \"a lot\" and most skyships therefore avoid it. Also, since there's no skyport in Bassuras , they'll have to drop them off there and go somewhere safer until they call to be picked up and returned to Jrusar .\n\nWhile practicing the Zeph'aeratam on deck, Orym spots a shadow in the sky, followed shortly by a second one. As they approach, the party sees that they are skirath hunters , and they are attacking. The skirath are incredibly fast and can shoot spines at multiple opponents as well as having a slam attack and a vicious poisonous tail barb, but the party is able to give damage as well as taking it. Ashton's rage takes the \"Space\" form and they are able to open portals to attack the distant creatures as though they were next to them. Fearne attempts to use Speak with Animals to talk to the skirath, but learns they are not beasts and the spell doesn't work on them. FCG is able to blind one, and Laudna Banes both. The party is also able to use the ballistae on the ship, which do significant damage to the flying creatures.\n\n![Imogen flying after Orym - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d9/Imogen_flying_after_Orym_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/375?cb=20220517011238)\n\nEventually, Orym kills one of the skirath, but is in turn attacked in retaliation by the other and pushed off the ship, hitting the sail as he falls. Laudna sees it happen and casts Feather Fall on him but the boat continues to sail away. Ashton kills the remaining creature with a hammer blow. The group urges the captain to turn the ship around to rescue Orym, but Imogen's eyes suddenly flare white and she floats upward, without even really understanding what's happening. She is able to fly to reach the slowly tumbling Orym, and fly with him back to the ship.\n\nThey harvest various body parts from the downed skirath before night falls. FCG catches Imogen alone and tells her that if she wants, he thinks he might be able to psychically connect her with Laudna so that Laudna could enter Imogen's dreams with her. Imogen and Laudna are both interested, and Imogen will think about it. Laudna points out that Ruidus is near zenith, and since Imogen's dreams get worse around that time, they can try it then. They also talk about FCG's persisting belief that the world is flat, and the possibility that people are living on the flip side of the coin-shaped world he imagines.\n\nLater, Fearne sneaks into Laudna's room and puts a wig she's crafted from her leg hair on Sashimi , Laudna's marionette partner for Pate de Rolo . Fearne leaves them in a sexy position. In the morning, Laudna is thrilled they were roleplaying together.\n\n![Laudna-Imogen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe day is uneventful. Toward evening, Laudna pulls Imogen aside to ask if she's all right. Imogen tells her she still has the gnarlrock and it makes her feel safe, but she doesn't think that's healthy. She's thought about getting rid of it, but she doesn't want to. Laudna feels uneasy at those words, as it reminds her of her own acquisition of power from an unsettling source, and she admits to Imogen that Delilah spoke to her while they were in the Heartmoor . [2] The stone's presence continues to disturb Laudna, and she eventually asks to hold it, promising not to do anything with it. As she touches it, she feels a growing pulse and the stone grows warmer as Laudna's vision fades and Delilah's voice in her mind says, \"Child, this is far too dangerous in your hands. I'll handle this.\" The heat strengthens till the stone is searing, the warmth traveling up her arms. Laudna demands to know what the stone is, but Delilah shushes her, saying, \"I've taken care of it for you.\" As the warmth hits Laudna's chest, the cold pulsing becomes a warm heartbeat. Her fingers open. The gem is cold and broken.\n\nImogen is at first speechless, then whispers, \"You lied!\" Laudna tries to explain, and promises to fix it, but Imogen just wants to go to bed. Laudna screams into the night, \"What did you do?!\" and feels the dull heartbeat and the warmth receding. Delilah's voice says, \"Don't worry, I've taken care of it. And thank you.\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e23-to_the_skies"}

After many days traveling across the broken, cracked, dust-filled wasteland that is the Hellcatch Valley , looking below day and night, you encountered some dangerous creatures that seemed to take to the skies that battled you on the deck of this very skyship, in which, through some daring escapes and some clutch uses of abilities and spells, prevented Orym from falling to his death immediately.\n\n![Imogen and Laudna after the gnarlrock is destroyed - JadeQ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5d/Imogen_and_Laudna_after_the_gnarlrock_is_destroyed_-_JadeQ.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220520125832)\n\nWith the possible final night of travel before the next final day of travel to the city of Bassuras, there was a discussion between Imogen and Laudna in which this strange crystal that you had scavenged from the interior of the Shade Mother 's lair back in Jrusar, that had been seemingly giving comfort and warmth and having some odd effects on Imogen, had been called into question. Laudna, following a strange internal push towards inspecting and learning the nature of it, grasped the gem upon the promise of nothing bad happening, and upon grasping it, watched as the arcane energy within was drawn out and into her, the crystal crumbling and cracking, left powerless and dark. Imogen stormed off to take a night's rest, wallowing in the sense of betrayal as Laudna screamed at the bow of the ship, nothing but the stars above and the moons to take it.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Moving the dusttra - Northyme](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/cc/Moving_the_dusttra_-_Northyme.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20220521005620)\n\nThe next morning, Orym notices a caravan traveling along the valley floor below them, and the ground shifting nearby as if something is burrowing below the ground heading toward it. He alerts Khalil , the crew, and the rest of Bells Hells . Trying to warn the caravan, Chetney uses the Horn of Silent Alarm but it appears to have no effect, while Imogen casts Fly on herself and takes off toward them. Captain Xandis recognizes the creature as a dusttra and in an attempt to pull the creature away the ship hits it with two chain-loaded ballista shots, lassoing it. The now-warned caravan reaches the safety of a rock outcropping.\n\nImogen makes mental contact with the dusttra, learning it has been captured and abused and its children taken. At Fearne 's suggestion, they decide to try to pick up the creature and carry it away. While they are working at chaining it, FCG talks to it and learns that it is searching for its children. Laudna casts Feather Fall on it, and once the three ship's chains are attached they are able to pull it upward and fly a short distance carrying it, but it is hauling itself up the chains toward the ship. When they release the chains, it plummets 50 feet to the ground below and digs itself in, and Ashton is seriously wounded when a bolt recoils into his body. When they check in with the rescued caravan, Laudna asks for a tip for the service provided, but the caravan members have virtually nothing.\n\nAs the sun sets, they see the lights of the city of Bassuras , and a green spotlight from a tall tower in its middle centers on them. The Captain sets them down outside the city and quickly takes off westward, away from potential scavengers and attackers, but Fearne manages to pickpocket their ornate spyglass as she hugs goodbye. The party is immediately confronted by a Crawler gang riding multiple wheeled constructs , and Ashton explains they are in town looking for somebody who pissed him off. When he gives his name, he is recognized as being \"from the House\". Although suspicious, the gang leader lets them go.\n\nThe party moves toward the city proper through the slum of the Carmine Skids, pretending they didn't just get off the retreating skyship, and realizing that they are being surreptitiously followed. At the 20-foot tall western city gate, they are confronted by the guards but admitted, and move on through the West Dregs of the ramshackle city to the Raha Den on the Salmagunda Strip. The Den is a caravanserai, a combination inn and shopping mall, where they rent three rooms. Once inside, Laudna looks into Lord Eshteross 's tracking sphere (which is attuned to Armand Treshi 's ring) [1] and sees a bright blue point of light within indicating the ring is within two miles in a southwestward direction. It does not appear to be moving, so they go to bed.\n\nThe night is uneventful although Fearne hears what sounds like a large bird landing nearby, and wakes FCG for their watch by inspecting them thoroughly. During their watch, FCG also hears the bird and can see it nesting somewhere above. They are extremely nervous, and at the end of their watch wake Chetney, warning him there is something out there and asking him to investigate, but Chetney sees only a normal-looking large hawk. Confused and curious, Chetney asks FCG to explain. FCG tells him that on \"the night everything changed\", there was a bird. The bird hates FCG, and wants them dead or humiliated. They don't know why. But it isn't a hawk, so this bird probably isn't it. Chetney pledges to protect FCG from the mysterious bird, which FCG has named \" Shithead \". Chetney also becomes a trusted companion of FCG.\n\nIn the morning, Chetney presents Laudna with her wooden gift: a small house to provide privacy for Pâté and Sashimi during the night, bringing her to tears of gratitude. The location of the glow in the location orb has not changed, and they start walking towards it. Suddenly, they hear a shout, demanding that someone give up their sword and drop what's on them. Investigating, they see a figure in shadows, surrounded by many other figures with weapons drawn, calling for help: a very slight, waifish-looking elf, who refuses their attackers' demands and threatens them with their rapier. Ashton rushes in to help.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Dusk casting Thunder Step - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThere are five attackers and they immediately go after the mysterious elf, seriously wounding her. One fires a crossbow at FCG , but misses, and Ashton retaliates, raging. The surrounded elf casts Thunder Step , taking herself to safety on a rooftop, while Bells Hells battle on the ground. Imogen twin spells Mind Whip but a wild magic surge causes all her hair to fall out. Chetney throws her his cap and she pulls it on her head.\n\nOrym accidentally runs into an invisible attacker and knocks him to the ground with a trip attack, then knocks him unconscious with a second blow. One of the remaining bandits casts Phantasmal Killer on Ashton, which over time causes massive psychic damage. As the battle continues, the party is both giving and receiving damage. Eventually, Chetney assumes his werewolf form and seriously wounds one, who is unable to flee because of a previous Command by FCG to him to \"monologue\" on his next turn. With a Lightning Bolt , Imogen succeeds in hitting three of the attackers, killing two of them. Orym stabilizes one of the downed bandits, then knocks another unconscious. Laudna kills the last remaining one with a Shocking Grasp , leaving all of them dead or unconscious.\n\nThe elf they rescued thanks them and apologizes for causing them trouble while Ashton loots one of the unconscious attackers. Laudna introduces the group and the elf tells them their name is Dusk , and although they know they're not from the city, they're a little fuzzy about where they are from. They exist in a sort of \"twilighty area\", touched by the Feywild . The last thing they remember is a beautiful and serene glen in the Feywild at sunset.\n\nFCG heals Dusk a bit. Meanwhile, Fearne wanders off into a nearby tent, encountering a very old woman sitting and eating amid the pungent smoke of some burning crystals in a brazier, seemingly suude . Fearne is able to mostly shake off its mildly hallucinogenic effects, and casually takes a saber and some other items she finds there while chatting with the happily stoned woman.\n\nWhen Fearne rejoins the party, she introduces herself to Dusk and tells her she's from the Feywild. They bond over their mutual desire to return there. Eventually the party decides to take the conversation to A Taste of Tal'Dorei , a theme restaurant in the South Dregs, which is in roughly the same direction as the location orb is pointing. As the group heads toward the restaurant, Laudna shares that the party is in Bassuras to capture an outlaw .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e24-the_hellcatch_valley"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E26-Hidden Truths","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells have been hot on the tail of Armand Treshi , who had escaped southeast from the city of Jrusar and vanished into the Hellcatch Valley . Tips that had been given via the network of aligned individuals to Eshteross said that he had gone toward Bassuras , where his alliances with the Paragon's Call would likely lead him to some sort of protection. Utilizing the enchanted ring that you had placed upon his finger, you head that way and quickly discover the ring had been pawned off, leaving the trail cold. However, you did discover the Seat of Disdain , the stronghold of which the Paragon's Call resides within the city, and figure that he's likely, possibly, within there.\n\nYou acquired the ring back, and had forged a plan that involved some elements of practiced forgery to try and draw him out, or at least confirm his location within. You had wandered and staked out the exterior and grounds of the Seat of Disdain. You went forward with a few different ideas, tossed around some plans. You had a brief encounter at the Taste of Tal'Dorei , a wonderful themed tavern and experience here in the city of Bassuras. You acquired some merch, some keepsakes, you got an oven mitt.\n\nYou've been traveling with an individual that you encountered when you came to the city, Dusk , an individual from the Fey Realm like Fearne , who seemed to be having a series of blocks in their memory. But an interesting connection to Fearne's past, as well. You've taken them under your wing. As you ventured away from the Seat of Disdain, back towards the Raha Den for a night's rest, that was where we left off.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nBack in their room in the Raha Den, Fearne and Dusk take the first watch. Fearne asks Dusk again about the Feywild and Fearne's parents, and shares that she is beginning to like it here, although the presence of rules about conduct is sometimes confusing. Dusk tells her that they think Fearne's parents might have been in trouble and never mentioned any grand plans to help save the Material Plane , although they regarded Dusk as family.\n\nWhen Dusk leaves to go to her room, Matt's requests everyone but Erika leave the table. Dusk feels a presence at the back of their mind, the voice of the Sorrowlord Zathuda , Grove Captain of the Unseelie Court . He asks if Dusk has located the Moontide Crown and dealt with the Calloways yet. Dusk tells him the Calloways have a daughter living in the mortal world who has led Dusk right to the Calloways. Zathuda replies that Sammanar grows impatient, and he expects the crown soon. Dusk assures him he will have it, and they will end the Calloway line. As Dusk lies down to sleep, there is a momentary flicker and a riot of color passes over their face before disappearing.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen has another dream. She stands within the red storm with her mother's voice urging her to run. Imogen sees the same female figure from her previous dream [1] walk slowly toward her, surrounded by other figures. The unfamiliar woman has short gray hair, dark eyes, and a hard, focused expression. She greets Imogen telepathically as more and more of the other figures step forward, all wearing dark gray and black leather armor and masks. As they suddenly rush toward Imogen, she wakes. Through the curtained walls of the Raha Den, she sees a faint orangish hue. The normally dull brownish-red Ruidus is momentarily flaring a vibrant red, and she feels herself drawn toward it with a faint yearning pull. Imogen asks FCG to draw the woman from the dream, but the sketch isn't very good. She tells FCG that Ruidus just flared, and he suggests that if they could figure out how to let him know when she's dreaming, he could see what she sees. He also tells her that Laudna shared with him that she and Imogen had argued, and suggests they should talk.\n\nOrym takes the final watch alone. He manages to steal Captain Xandis 's spyglass [2] from Fearne without being noticed, then wakes the party at dawn to continue planning their next steps. They decide to split the party. Laudna and Orym will watch Paragon's Call 's stronghold for signs of Armand Treshi ; FCG, Fearne, and Dusk will go to FCG's local friend; and Ashton , Imogen, and Chetney will track down Ashton's contacts at All-Minds-Burn .\n\n![Team Building - cvleart](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/62/Team_Building_-_cvleart.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220711111927)\n\nWhen the party goes downstairs, they are confronted by a ten-person delegation from Paragon's Call. Bells Hells' scouting of their stronghold the previous day was noticed. Imogen's tale of simply trying to help a really cute creature doesn't go well, but the combination of Chetney's thrown wood chisel, Laudna's Unsettling Presence, and Ashton's previous job offer from General Ratanish [3] convinces the emissary to give them till the next day to contact Ratanish and join the Call.\n\nAshton's group heads to All-Minds-Burn, meeting Justi Pross , their leader. The gang members seem to communicate telepathically with one another, and when Imogen tries to push into their minds, she is met with all-consuming static and realizes they are some form of hive mind controlled from below. She is forced to pull away, and as she does her nose starts bleeding. Justi tells Ashton the group could help hide Armand Treshi if they succeed in capturing him, and suggests they challenge Paragon's Call to The Run. All-Minds-Burn can help them cheat if they do. When they leave, Imogen tells the others about the hive mind, but Ashton ascribes it to the drugs the group takes. They decide The Run is a good idea. They're going to need to buy a car.\n\nFCG, Dusk, and Fearne head to Finders Takers, a boutique scrap and black powder shop run by Esmer , who is surprised to see Fresh Cut Grass and asks if Dancer sent them. FCG tries to gently tell her Dancer was brutally murdered a few months ago, but Esmer tells them that's impossible. Dancer came alone to the shop a month ago trying to reconnect with Esmer, and Esmer bought her sad stories and let her stay for a few days. But when things got \"a little too intimate\", Dancer vanished again. Esmer is very angry about it, and definitely, positively doesn't want an apology from her... unless she's ready to apologize in person, maybe. By the way, Dancer now has a metal arm . She's probably at The Ends. They order a wall-breaking explosive, and purchase five sticks of dynamite.\n\nAfter the others leave, Fearne asks Esmer about Fresh Cut Grass's \"fritzing\" episodes, but she can suggest only it might be due to the melding of technologies when FCG was assembled. FCG is very shaken by learning that Dancer is still alive, and they decide to go find the others.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nOn the way to Paragon's Call 's stronghold the Seat of Disdain , Orym stops and buys himself and Laudna matching hooded scarves so they can pose as mother and child. Orym asks her about her intense reaction to being separated from Imogen earlier, and Laudna confesses this is their first really big fight. She is very upset and getting conflicting advice. They separate at Paragon's Call and begin surveillance. At dusk, Orym briefly sees three figures on the roof, one of which is Armand Treshi . Eventually Laudna Messages him and he passes this on to her..\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party meet up in The Ends on the outskirts of Sonyan Row, where there are piles of bent and rusty pieces of crawlers and automatons around equally bent and rusty shacks. FCG Sends to Laudna and Orym to join them there, and the group heads to the shop of Imahara Joe , who has become the go-to person of the Crawler gangs for repairs and alterations. Joe lets them in, cautiously, and they explain they need to buy a crawler to compete in the Deathwish Run . Joe explains the race and its rules (or lack thereof) to them.\n\n![Imahara Joe - Sarah Birdzell](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/51/Imahara_Joe_-_Sarah_Birdzell.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220711220932)\n\nThey decide to get one of the skirmish-crawlers, offering Fresh Cut Grass as potential collateral, but Joe turns it down because of FCG's obvious sentience. After discussing potential modifications and additions to the vehicle, they pay half the 1450 total cost as a deposit. It will be ready mid-afternoon the next day.\n\nAs they're getting ready to leave, Fearne asks Joe if he knows Birdie or Oleander Calloway . Joe does, and she looks like Birdie. They come in every few months for power sources and occasional scrap, and have for a couple of years now. Fearne notices the power sources are very similar to the orbs that the Nightmare King had in his laboratory. They are, in essence, arcane batteries drawing from local ley lines .\n\nJoe asks FCG if he used to run with someone named Dancer . He remembers when the then-disabled FCG came through on a trade caravan, Joe wanted to buy him but Dancer got him first. FCG corrects him; Dancer didn't buy him, she built him. But Joe is certain. FCG is a grade-A scavenged automaton , pre-Divergence, of Aeorian design. He is definitely an Aeormaton , because only the Aeorians were able to create sentient automatons. When FCG insists Dancer built him, Joe mentions that there have been some in the past five years that have been coming online, reawakened. [4]\n\nFCG is obviously shaken, but seems to accept this. His concern is that his programming may turn out to be something other than what he now knows himself to be.\n\nThe party discusses everything that's happened, trying to put together the disparate pieces of information, and realizing that many of the pieces seem to have a connection to the Feywild. Fearne shows them some of the homemade postcards she received from her parents, allegedly from Aeor. FCG casts Identify on them, but learns nothing more.\n\nThey decide to rest for the night, but somewhere different since Paragon's Call knows where they were last night. They head to a rugged caravan-serai named the Rubble and Break with subterranean rooms.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e26-hidden_truths"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E25-A Taste of Tal'Dorei (episode)","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells have been hot on the trail of Armand Treshi after uncovering many of the misdeeds he had been attempting within the city of Jrusar . With their alliance with Lord Eshteross , they had helped place a platinum band that had been enchanted at a ball with the help of their friend Dorian . Upon putting this ring upon Armand to keep tracking his whereabouts in the city, you left northward and returned a bit later to discover that he had left. He had fled the city southeast. You agreed to help Eshteross in hunting him down, taking the orb that was affixed to the enchantment on this ring, to when you were within proximity, you would know the direction he was from you.\n\nYou went ahead and took upon the skyship known as the Silver Sun , and went southeast across the skies of the Hellcatch Valley towards the city of Bassuras , where it seemed Armand was laying low. On this trek, you did battle with a number of dangerous sky creatures. You helped defend a caravan that was being hunted by a wayward dusttra , a massive squid-like creature digging through the dust. Upon coming to the outskirts of Bassuras, the skyship left you behind, within a day's journey should you require it to return and pick you up.\n\nHere, you made contact with one of the many Crawler gangs that run the region surrounding the city. You began to mark continuous shapes and colors of tattoo-based designs that mark the Gajakhandas , the ones that protect the main guardian laws of the city. Upon walking into the center, you found your way to the caravanserai the Raha Den, purchased a night's rest, and then emerged to seek out the directional blip of Armand's tracking signal in the orb that you carry.\n\nOn the way, you heard a scuffle in a nearby alleyway and saw this individual, Dusk , being harried by a number of ne'er-do-wells, cutthroats that were attempting to take what was theirs. You then stepped into this alleyway and came to their aid, beating down these individuals and leaving them behind as you made your first encounter and introduction with this character, Dusk. Now, after having a brief bit of conversation, you decided to continue to pursue the directional draw of this arcane blip. Along the way, it seems, in the southern direction of the city of Bassuras, there lay a particular tavern, referred to as \" A Taste of Tal'Dorei \" that seemed to reside at least in a similar space of the region.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![A Taste of Tal'Dorei - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a0/A_Taste_of_Tal%27Dorei_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20220706145933)\n\nThe party justifies the trip to A Taste of Tal'Dorei on the basis that they can rest while there, and also possibly learn more about Armand Treshi and his current location. Along the way, they encounter an eight-foot-tall, apparently cobbled together and slightly glitchy automaton . FCG attempts to engage it in conversation without success.\n\nA Taste of Tal'Dorei is a theme restaurant with servers taking the roles of famous figures from Tal'Doreian history, including Errevon , Zan Tal'Dorei , and Warren Drassig . They order food and drink. Dusk explains she is looking for the people in a locket she wears, which holds the images of Fearne 's parents. They helped Dusk get back to the Material Plane from the Feywild but Dusk got separated from them. She has no idea how much time has passed since she went there and her memories are vague and non-chronological. Dusk's warlock powers come from a tattoo of waves, terminating in geometric shapes-- but she doesn't remember getting it.\n\nFearne confirms it's been about ninety years since she last saw her parents, who left to do \"something very, very important\" when she was very young, leaving her with her grandmother to keep her safe. Her family is very important and very well known in the Courts . She might or might not be a princess.\n\nWith Fearne's consent, Imogen telepathically reaches out to Fearne's mother Birdie , telling her Fearne and Dusk are looking for her. The response is cautious at first, but when Fearne and Dusk provide details only they would know, Birdie becomes very excited. She and Ollie are a few days out from Bassuras , but they'll meet at \"Joe's\". They discover the waitress knows of an \" Imahara Joe 's\" in The Ends, who is a tinkerer that works on crawlers .\n\nLaudna pulls FCG into the gift shop, telling him she and Imogen have had a falling out since Laudna accidentally destroyed Imogen's gnarlrock shard. Laudna tells FCG that she just wants Imogen to have a life and a youth, and she just wanted to protect her from something that might hurt her. She is very upset by the situation. FCG volunteers to help facilitate a conversation between the two when they are both ready.\n\n![The souvenirs - Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/11/The_souvenirs_-_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20220704025903)\n\nMeanwhile, Orym checks in with Imogen, who has seemed discouraged lately. She shares that Laudna and she had a falling out, and although in hindsight it now seems like it was a good thing Laudna did, Imogen can't tell her that yet. She is also upset that while she's hurting, Laudna seems to be living it up with the new person, Dusk, like she doesn't even care they had a fight. Orym tells her that she and Laudna are so very close, this estrangement won't last forever, and that she's done amazing things for all the others. She shouldn't get down on herself. And she should talk to Laudna.\n\nThey leave the tavern into midday Bassuras, following the blip in the tracking sphere to the Bank of Renewal marketplace. Imogen reminds the group she still has the marble-like bead which can encapsulate an enemy that they got from the Green Seekers . [1] The sphere leads them to a tent called the River of Renewal, a pawn shop, and they realize that the ring they are tracking has not moved in some time, is somewhere inside the tent, and may have been pawned. Dusk goes inside and eventually is shown the correct ring. Under Dusk's Suggestion , the shopkeeper tells her it was pawned by Armand Treshi , and he's probably with his gang, the Paragon's Call , at their fortress called the Seat of Disdain. The party decides to leave the ring there in case Treshi returns to redeem it, and head toward the Seat of Disdain.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nOn the way, FCG encounters another non-responsive automaton , and they again have a discussion about the nature of FCG's consciousness. They also see a huge crawler traveling platform. When they reach the Seat of Disdain, it proves to be a well-guarded and defended three-story fortress in the middle of a residential neighborhood. They discuss possible approaches. Eventually, Imogen , Orym , Dusk , and Fearne take a walk around the perimeter while Laudna , Ashton , and FCG stay with Chetney at a distance.\n\n![Quokka Fearne - arcticwaters](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFearne wild shapes into a devastatingly cute quokka , runs up to the front gates and tries to dig under them, but gets stuck while trying to squeeze through. Imogen helps her dig telekinetically and eventually, she emerges in a training courtyard on the other side. While trying to reach the front door, however, she is spotted and grabbed by one of the guards, who immediately adopts her, names her Fuzz Bottom, and carries her inside the fortress.\n\nMeanwhile, Dusk runs nearer the other group, signaling frantically until Laudna Messages her. She tells them what's happening and they decide to wait a bit before deciding what action to take, if any.\n\nThe soldier takes Fearne to her barracks and locks her in after feeding her. Trapped, Fearne paws at the door until another soldier investigates and, captivated, kidnaps her. As they move through the fortress, Fearne spots General Ratanish , the leader of Paragon's Call . When they reach the soldier's quarters, he tries to lock Fearne in his footlocker but her struggles (and bites) wake his sleeping roommate. Now annoyed, the soldier marches Fearne back out through the courtyard and tosses her out through the gate, unhurt.\n\nAs the groups move to rejoin, Dusk asks Imogen if she and Laudna are \"a thing\". After a pause, Imogen replies simply, \"No.\" At the same time, Ashton asks Laudna about the tension between her and Imogen, and Laudna tearfully tells him she did something terrible: she killed Imogen's rock . Ashton suggests maybe they should find her a nice rock to give to Imogen as a replacement and an apology.\n\nBack together again, Fearne tells everyone she could sketch a map of the interior of the fortress, but otherwise she didn't learn much beyond seeing Ratanish there. They discuss possible plans to try to lure out Treshi so they can confirm he's actually present in the fortress. Imogen goes back to the River of Renewal and buys a ring, getting a receipt from the pawnbroker so they can copy his handwriting. Orym manages to do a credible forgery of a note purporting to be from the pawnbroker, addressed to Treshi, giving him a last opportunity to redeem the ring. They go back to the inn to sleep for the night.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e25-a_taste_of_tal'dorei_(episode)"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E28-The Deathwish Run","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: our troop of heroes had made their way to the city of Bassuras in the middle of the Hellcatch Valley , in search of Armand Treshi , who has been on the run. You managed to discover and confirm that he has been hiding out in the Seat of Disdain , the center of the Paragon's Call Crawler gang that sits within the city. As part of your intent to find a way to gather more influence or to safely get into this fortress called the Seat of Disdain, you met with a contact, General Ratanish , and spoke on your interest in joining this Crawler gang, upon which some of you met the leader of Paragon's Call, Otohan Cruel-- or Thull, who has a unique history.\n\nAs part of the process of being initiated, or proving your worth to join the Paragon's Call, you agreed to take place in the Deathwish Run , which is a dangerous, deadly race that takes place through and around the city of Bassuras. This more recent race that's being designed as part of your request to join was set for that dusk. And so, you've all begun to prepare yourselves for this race in the short time that you have.\n\nIn the meantime, you've also had some unique character revelations, some interesting bits of information come your way about some of you, and in the morrow, the following day, supposedly, Birdie Calloway is to be arriving within the city and there is a coming meeting.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party arrives at the starting/ending point of the Deathwish Run , the Bone Tree in The Skids, where a large crowd has gathered around the four other racers already there. Of the party's two crawler skirmishers , Ashton will drive the one they name the \"Red Moon\", with Imogen riding shotgun, marked with a little red moon. Chetney will drive the other, named \"Buck Fucket\", with Laudna in the rear seat. They also want Fresh Cut Grass to ride on this crawler and eventually decide to use a tanglefoot bag to glue them to its front in place of the front wheel. Orym paints two angry eyebrows and jaws on FCG, then he and Dusk head to the hairpin turns into the Ravine.\n\nFearne tries to sneak in squirrel form onto Paragon's Call 's racer, named \"Jamil Toetaker\", but is caught and shot, forcing her back into her true form. Imogen notices General Ratanish and Otohan Thull observing from a distance, and realizes Otohan is the woman from her dreams. Just as night falls, the race begins and Laudna casts Bane on two of their competition's crews.\n\nAmid gun and crossbow fire, the crawlers charge off. Laudna uses her Form of Dread to frighten one of the other drivers so that he has to try to move away from her, while Imogen Commands another to brake but is gashed by a greataxe attack. Laudna is hit with rifle fire. Ashton's Rage for this section of the race takes the \"Gravity\" form, and FCG's Spirit Guardians take the form of turtle shells.\n\n![Imogen's lightning bolt in the Deathwish Run - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/e1/Imogen%27s_lightning_bolt_in_the_Deathwish_Run_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/425?cb=20220725002310)\n\nWith spells, weapon attacks, and explosives, the race continues through the Skids of Bassuras and into the hairpin turns leading into the ravine, with a little old lady crossing the road being the only collateral damage. Imogen and Laudna both are taking significant damage, and FCG attempts to help with healing but is limited by what he can see from his position as the front wheel. Chetney and FCG's crawler has a metallic net thrown over it, slowing them and causing damage until Chetney tears it free by assuming his wolf form. Imogen casts Lightning Bolt on the driver who threw the net, causing him and his crawler to explode, out of the race.\n\nOrym leaps into one of the competitors' vehicles and succeeds in booting the driver out of it. He's quickly joined by Dusk who manages to throw the passenger out as well. Imogen casts Blindness on another of the drivers, who eventually drives off the side of the cliff and explodes.\n\nWith only the Paragon's Call crawler remaining as a rival, they reach the pitch black caverns at the bottom of the ravine and plunge into darkness.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![The Kagaronk screenshot 3x28](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/4c/The_Kagaronk_screenshot_3x28.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20220726134915)\n\nInside the cavern, they are immediately attacked by flocks of bats. Orym expends the blue rose he found while traveling to the museum heist to cast a cone of lightning on the Paragon's Call crawler , their sole remaining rival in the race, sending the driver flying to impale himself on the back of Chetney and Laudna's crawler. Ashton then uses Density Well to brake in front of the crawler, causing it to slam into the back of Ashton's crawler and destroy itself.\n\nWith none of their rivals still in the competition, the racers briefly think they can relax... until a growl comes out of the darkness. They see green glows emanating from a massive beast, a kagaronk that looks like a multi-legged scaled leopard. It runs alongside them as they continue racing forward. Preparing to be attacked, Chetney and Laudna trade places so she is now driving. Although the creature takes significant damage, it is powerful as well and uses its legendary actions for a 20-foot Tail Whirlwind Strike against most of the party, in addition to claw and bite attacks. Orym knocks the creature prone, Ashton steers around it, and they manage to outrace it out of the cavern.\n\n![FCG and Laudna in the Deathwish Run - BlackSalander](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b7/FCG_and_Laudna_in_the_Deathwish_Run_-_BlackSalander.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220725002804)\n\nThe three crawlers are now racing up the switchbacks of the ravine back toward The Skids and the finish line. Two figures on a platform above the route push a heavy boulder onto the path, which Orym and Ashton are able to evade, and Ashton uses a chaos burst to pull Laudna closer to him and escape most of the damage. Suddenly, they see the bloodied and growling kagaronk drag itself straight up the ravine side and onto the path before them. It attacks Laudna, knocking her unconscious. Since she was driving, FCG feels himself being steered into the cliffside but by using his grappling cannon, avoids hitting it. Orym is able to seriously wound the creature and keep it from attacking Laudna or Chetney any further, and Ashton finishes it off.\n\n![Fearne and Little Mister at the finish line - Elaine Tipping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nDusk leaps from her position on Orym's crawler onto Laudna's, and uses Lay on Hands to bring her back to consciousness (which is an ability that as Warlock she should not have had) with one hit point. Dusk goes back to Orym's crawler and they head toward the finish line through the dust storm that has blown up. At that moment, several spectators pull on chains, releasing spears on springs flipping out from boxes in the road, creating a bladed barricade. Stationed near the finish line, Fearne sees this and manages to widen the safe gap to 15 feet instead of 10, but in her efforts manages to fall into the portable hole . Although none of the drivers spot the barrier ahead of time, Laudna and Orym are able to get through the gap, but Ashton doesn't. Their crawler wipes out, mangling both the crawler and its passengers as the other two crawlers cross the finish line.\n\nBarely alive, Laudna stumbles toward Imogen, and Ashton stumbles into the hole while looking for Fearne. While helping her out, he tries to pickpocket her, but she notices the attempt. The owners of Orym's purloined vehicle approach and ask for (and receive) its return. General Ratanish and Otohan Thull approach with a small group of soldiers from Paragon's Call and Imogen ducks behind Fearne. The party has been accepted into the Call and will be given quarters in the barracks.\n\nImogen takes Laudna to FCG for a little healing. FCG is badly damaged from the stresses of the race, and his speech is glitching again. They slowly walk him, still attached to the crawler, to Imahara Joe who releases him and and offers to repair and polish him overnight. Ashton stays there with him. The rest of the party head back to their inn, and on the way, Imogen telepathically tells Laudna that Otohan is the woman in her dreams. Laudna also takes Dusk aside, thanks her for saving her life, but nervously and apologetically tells her she's not ready for an emotional relationship. Dusk accepts this and as they walk off arm in arm, Imogen casts Detect Thoughts on Dusk, but there is nothing there to grasp onto; Dusk's mind is thoroughly blocked off.\n\nAt the inn, Chetney approaches Dusk and congratulates her on her performance in the race. He then offers to help her capture the Calloways if she'll share the bounty with him. She denies knowing what he's talking about; she's not trying to kill Fearne's parents. He succeeds on an insight check and gets a whisper from Erika as to whether Dusk is lying. Fearne comes over and admits she is nervous about meeting her parents in the morning, but when Chetney leaves, Dusk tells her about Chetney's accusation. Dusk seems horrified and very upset, but Fearne thinks Chetney is just kidding. She is thinking positive thoughts about having a good day tomorrow, and they bond over that. Meanwhile, Orym has read the lips of every one of the conversations, including Chetney's. That evening, Imogen attempts once more to push into Dusk's thoughts while Dusk sleeps, but it's like a wall preventing her from peeking.\n\nIn the morning, they head to Imahara Joe's to rejoin FCG and Ashton. As they near it, a skirmish crawler parks in front and a female faun gets off, dust-covered from travel, and goes in. Only Ashton and FCG are there and she asks them to tell Joe that Birdie's here. Ashton shouts this to Joe. Outside, the rest of the party hears Ashton's shout, sending Fearne into a panic.\n\n![Birdie meeting Fearne - Kiera James](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nJoe greets Birdie, asking how many she's looking for this time, and Birdie responds that they're \"getting real close,\" so she'll take whatever they can spare. Fearne nervously enters, and they see each other. Nervously tidying herself, Birdie runs up, grabs Fearne, and lifts her into a hug. They lovingly and haltingly greet each other, but when Fearne says it's been 90 years, Birdie responds it's been close to six years. Fearne points out Dusk, saying Birdie knows her, but Birdie doesn't think they've met.\n\nSuddenly, the tattoo on Dusk's arm springs to life, \"a roiling, crashing ocean. As the waves break, they splinter off into geometric patterns that multiply and divide.\" They crawl up Dusk's arm to their face, where they drain of color into an opalescent rainbow hue. Dusk's form has changed, becoming tall and wiry. Their face has sharper features, and their clothes turn inside out to reveal black robes. Their true form is a changeling.\n\nBirdie, holding Fearne's hand, steps back, but Dusk grabs both of them. Birdie gasps out to Fearne, \"You led them right to us.\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e28-the_deathwish_run"}

You were also here to break into the Twilight Mirror Museum at the behest of Ms. Jiana Hexum , to both embarrass, if possible, the proprietor of it, as well as win a wager that she had made with Evon Hytroga .\n\nYou managed to break in against a competitive burglary team known as The Verdict . You got caught in a lot of traps, and they got caught in some traps too, and you gave traps to each other, and then you fought some weird clay golem things. Then you repeatedly hit a button and burned the fuck out of the other team. And you won the wager. You retrieved the specific object that was notified to be waiting for you at the end of the museum safely, more or less, and in doing so won the arrangement for Hexum. On your way out, you delved into seemingly some sort of a shared or uniquely parallel history with one of the local carvers in the space, other crafters of fine wooden and other materials, as well as running into Roe Estani on the way out, who had been contemplating the conversations you had had and trusted you with a little more information about some sort of a troop, or a group, that referred to themselves as the Grim Verity that seemed to be heading up some of the similar research into these same astral oddities that the Lumas twins had been looking into, themselves seemingly, possibly members.\n\nUpon leaving, you mounted your horses and headed southward on a relatively safe journey back, having knowing the roads a little better, managed to avoid any serious conflict or issues.

The party spends the night at the Spire by Fire Inn . During the night, Ashton has fragmented dreams of their past, the failed burglary at the manor of Jiana Hexum and its aftermath. While he sleeps, Fearne studies the glass-filled hole in his head and the colors moving within it.\n\nIn the morning, they travel to Jiana's home. Once inside, they follow the sound of a violin to find Jiana with her music teacher Dinah Veshur. They give Jiana the papers stolen from Evon Hytroga and receive their payment, and she confirms Ashton's debt to her is paid. Fearne asks for and receives permission to take one of the magical busts from the entryway.\n\nJiana asks to speak to FCG alone and Ashton remains as well. She asks FCG who was his creator, and he tells her about Dancer while she inspects him closely, to which he eventually objects. Jiana is very interested in automatons and finds that FCG's level of awareness is unique. Ashton, meanwhile, finds that being back in this room is causing more fragmented memories to return, and once downstairs Ashton sees a half-hidden wooden container of about the same size as the crate they remember removing something from just before all their memories go blank. On the way out, Ashton helps Fearne remove the heavy magical bust and takes it with them.\n\nOn the way to Lord Eshteross 's home, FCG tells the party again about his past and the evisceration of Dancer and the rest of FCG's party, the Division of Public Benefit . They reach Eshteross's house and find him training, but he receives them warmly.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n“\nI am ever appreciative for delivering our friend across the sea to us for proper remembrance and burial. We are deeply saddened at Bertrand's passing, and thank you for being compatriots of his until his honored end. He was a man of deep integrity, courageous heart, and boundless generosity. You have my gratitude and the gratitude of the entire Chamber of Whitestone.~ Lady Vex'ahlia de Rolo, Baroness of the First House of Whitestone, Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt, Coinmistress of the Council of Tal'Dorei.\n”\n\n– \nThe letter from Lady Vex'ahlia de Rolo.[1]\n[!h]\n\n\n\n\nLord Eshteross tells them that Lady Emoth 's capture and interrogation proved Armand Treshi 's guilt as a conspirator. Orlana Seshadri has personally taken charge of the investigation and Armand fled the city towards Bassuras , the home of Paragon's Call , which Eshteross was able to track because of the ring the party planted on Armand at the ball. [2] Eshteross asks the party to pursue Armand to Bassuras before he escapes the continent entirely. He offers his skyship , the Silver Sun , as transport there, since it has returned from transporting Bertrand Bell 's body to Whitestone , and brought a letter from Lady Vex'ahlia de Rolo thanking the party.\n\nThe skyship will be free for the next month, and will take about four to five days to reach Bassuras. Yios would be about three days further from there. Eshteross also gives them a map of the Hellcatch Valley and the tracking ball through which they can locate Armand once he is within a couple of miles. The skyship will leave for Bassuras in the morning.\n\n![Hellcatch Valley screenshot - Deven Rue](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/c8/Hellcatch_Valley_screenshot_-_Deven_Rue.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220506070231)\n\nThe party leaves for the Dayal Hall in search of Ajit Dayal . There, a suspicious guard stops them at the entrance but fetches him after Imogen tells him they were sent by Professor Gryz . Ajit greets them, and is surprised to hear they are working with Lord Eshteross. Chetney explains that he met Gryz at the ball, and Ajit escorts them to his office and makes them tea.\n\nChetney explains he came to Jrusar to meet with Gurge Kisgregg , and that they share a condition , which Ajit immediately understands. Chetney is seeking Ajit's help in locating the Gorgynei , and turns down Ajit's offer to help him cure his lycanthropy . Ajit tells them the Gorgynei are currently in the Gloomed Jungles of Aeshanadoor , where they are able to remain hidden from those hunting the hides of lycanthropes for the bounty upon them. Controlling lycanthropy is difficult and the beast within cannot always be restrained, but the Gorgynei have somehow found a way to do so. When questioned, Chetney initially denies he has ever lost control, but eventually confesses he may have slipped up a couple times. Once the group is alone, he admits the moment during the heist that he clawed Orym , [3] and suggests that it was because of how injured he was at the time. Perhaps during their travels, when he is in wolf form they should keep their distance or make sure he is healed. He also admits he has a sensitivity to silver.\n\nThey then head to the Trove of Marwa , where she offers them, among other things, a portable hole . Fearne immediately jumps into it, finding herself in a 10-foot deep cylinder about six feet wide, containing a few short swords, some clothing, and a broken wooden chest. They buy it along with a Butcher's Bib , Horn of Silent Alarm , two healing potions , and some powdered silver for FCG .\n\nThey drop off another 10 gold to Zhudanna on their way to Krook House , where Milo greets them and at FCG's request crafts a propeller to substitute for his saw blade in swimming or falling situations. Ashton asks Milo what they remember about the job burgling Jiana's house in which Ashton was badly injured and incurred the debt, but Milo doesn't remember much, and it feels weirdly fuzzy. Milo isn't sure if they set off a trap, but they were hit with a wave that made everything dreamlike, and they ran, not realizing Ashton had fallen and was seriously hurt until they were outside. They brought Ashton back to Krook House, and while Milo was repairing him, Milo noticed Ashton clutching something: a crystal vial about four inches long containing weird greyish liquid with an odd sheen . Not knowing what else to do, Milo poured it into Ashton's head before pouring in the glass that completed the repair.\n\nAfter dinner, the party returns to the Spire by Fire and their rooms. With Chetney guarding the hall, and with Ashton's agreement, FCG bonds with both Imogen and Ashton and attempts to stabilize Ashton while Imogen dives deeply into his mind with Detect Thoughts . She tells Ashton to tell them everything possible about the night of the injury. As Imogen asks questions, Ashton begins to get flashes of memory: a dark corner table of a tavern with figures (including Milo) seated around it. One figure says, \"These shipments she's getting are timed. There's something to it. I think tonight's our chance.\" Another flash: running in the street. Another flash: quietly creeping on a wooden floor in front of the white bust that Fearne now has.\n\nImogen pushes deeper, and Ashton sees a strange room, runes on the floor beginning to light up and glow. It blinks to before that, and there is a crate hidden off to the side. Ashton crowbars it open, then looks over their shoulder to see a woman named Sally hurrying Ashton as his hand reaches in and rummages to the sound of glass clinking, then pulls a crystal vial free as the dull red runes begin to glow in the chamber. Another flash: falling from the balcony. FCG casts Calm Emotions on Ashton as the memories continue: a frantic voice, another saying, \"He's dead, just leave him,\" and blurred images. Then a bright unfocused light, flickering shapes lightly drifting, and Milo asking, \"Are you okay?\" The spell ends.\n\nAshton (still under Calm Emotions ) isn't sure how he feels until the spell drops. He immediately jumps up and starts pounding on the wall, furious. After a few minutes, he calms, and sits. Ashton tells the others Jiana had one of those crates in her office when they were there. He also recognized all of the other figures in the memories. Ashton could tell that Milo's memories weren't right, either; there was a hole.\n\nAshton just wants to get out of town, hoping that since the Nobodies met in Bassuras, perhaps some of them are still there. The party decides to go to bed. When everyone else is asleep, Orym uses the sending stone to tell Dorian where they're going, and that he's been missed. Dorian replies that he's missed them all, too.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e22-promise_and_potential"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E30-Reunion & Revelation","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off: Bells Hells trekked to the city of Bassuras in the Hellcatch Valley in search of Armand Treshi , who had escaped Jrusar as a fugitive. You were sent by Lord Eshteross to go retrieve him to bring him to justice. While there, you made a friend named Dusk who had a weird tangential history to Fearne 's family. Along with you they traveled, and you met Birdie Calloway , upon which realizing that this individual Dusk was not who they seemed and was actually an Unseelie assassin, sent to wipe out the Calloway bloodline and retrieve something that your parents had stolen from the Unseelie.\n\nAfter some tense conversation and some uncertainty of who to trust, you made a deal with the individual known as Yu , who was the actual individual behind Dusk, that in 30 or so days they would return, in which the crown that would no longer be necessary for what seems to be the coming Apogee Solstice could be returned to the Unseelie and you would be left unharmed. Now after this arrangement had been made and they were let to leave, some quick catching up was had between you and your mother, while the rest of you took the rest of the day to gather your things and prepare for the following day's journey, in which Birdie Calloway was going to lead you to the hideout where she and Fearne's father currently reside and are building something with their seemingly long-term ally, Ira Wendagoth , the Nightmare King.\n\nSo, you gathered your single now-repaired skirmish-crawler . After briefly leaving and forgetting and then returning for your delightful new friend and ally Hondir , you made your way out of the city to the east, tearing across the open badlands that is the Hellcatch , following her and her crawler towards this location.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party heads out of town on their crawlers , Birdie Calloway leading the way toward the edge of the mesa and a bridge crossing the ravine to another, smaller mesa. Coming the opposite way is another skirmish-crawler. As it passes at high speed, they notice red streaks coming down from the eyes of the driver - the mark of rank of the Fist of the Ruiner gang in Bassuras . Orym notices a figure standing on the mesa they are approaching, and a puff of smoke like a flare rising behind them. As they reach the other end of the bridge, a metal barrier rises in front of them, but both vehicles evade it with minimal damage. However, a much larger three-legged, gun-equipped crawler vehicle emerges from the rocks and Maracris, the leader of the brigands atop it, demands they stop, or die. They have been marked by \"his eye\" and must pay tribute by leaving their belongings, including weapons, money, and automatons.\n\nChetney and Laudna drop Paragon's Call 's name, but it has no apparent effect. Imogen picks up the backpack containing their bomb and sets it down by the leg of the Fist of the Ruiner crawler, apparently complying with their demand. After mentally telling Orym and Fresh Cut Grass to back up, Imogen triggers the bomb, significantly damaging the enemy crawler and its occupants.\n\n![Imogen's lightning bolt - BlackSalander](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/82/Imogen%27s_lightning_bolt_-_BlackSalander.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220813041750)\n\nIn the aftermath, they notice several gang members emerging from behind them as well. Orym sprints toward the vehicle and uses his Boots of Striding and Springing to leap atop it. There, he sees a huge gun, manned by a gunner who sprays shots at the rest of the party. Imogen fires lightning at three gang members and the huge gun on the ruiner-crawler, killing one of the gunners, but the black powder within the large gun ignites, setting off 60 shots at once and destroying the gun. Hondir is hit and knocked unconscious while the rest of the party takes significant damage, and two of the gang members are killed outright. The remainder continue to fight back with their other guns, however, and a mage casts Vitriolic Sphere on the party including Birdie, hitting most of them for serious damage, and knocking out FCG and Imogen. Birdie retaliates with a Charm Person on the caster while Fearne revives FCG with Cure Wounds . FCG then heals Imogen, but immediately thereafter falls unconscious again from the continuing acid damage as the enemy crawler begins retreating.\n\nAs the party and the remaining crawler gang members continue fighting, the residual acid damage from the sphere knock out Imogen. Ashton is able to bring back FCG and Chetney brings back Imogen with Potions of Healing . Fearne manages to kill the gunner with Scorching Ray , being pickpocketed by Ashton of a thimble as she passes him. FCG bring Hondir back to consciousness, but Birdie goes unconscious from the acid. Her crawler is still running and runs over Maracris, killing him. The remaining gang members flee to the crawler which continues to retreat, but Laudna casts Darkness on it. Three minutes later they hear the crash as it falls off the other side of the mesa. Fearne brings Birdie back to consciousness.\n\nThe party notes that since some of the brigands got away, they might now be known to be enemies of the Fist of the Ruiner. They also note how little using Paragon's Call's name affected the other gang. They loot the bodies, noticing the tattooed red teardrop streaks on their faces, the iconography of the Ruiner . Orym remembers that long ago Marquet was a lush continent, but during the Calamity Gruumsh attempted to destroy it, being prevented at the last minute by a hero . The Ruiner's destruction therefore only affected a third of the continent rather than its entirety. They also find 420 gold pieces and two carbine rifles on the bodies, before roaring off back on their journey to the Calloways' hideout.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nBells Hells , Birdie , and Hondir continue their hour-long journey across the Helcatch , eventually reaching a small platform under a mesa-cliff overhang with a concealed cave opening. Inside, a tunnel leads to the Calloways' hideout, filled with lush greenery growing in the light of multiple small glowing purplish stones . Birdie tells the party Ira Wendagoth told them it's not healthy for them to actually touch them.\n\nBirdie welcomes them. She confirms Ira Wendagoth had mentioned he'd met someone in Jrusar that reminded him of the Calloways . While she and Chetney go back outside to erase the crawler tracks, the others go further in to the laboratory, which holds a 30-foot tall telescope-like construct pointed toward a hole in the roof of the rock-hewn chamber. Oleander greets Fearne joyously, expressing surprise at her age, 112. Ira greets the party as well, less joyously. After introductions, Fearne give Ollie the Weave Lens her grandmother gave her to give to her parents, and Ollie immediately hands it to Ira.\n\n![Ira Wendagoth - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/46/Ira_Wendagoth_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20220815015847)\n\nIra apologizes to the party for their previous encounter, [1] saying he was \"merely following instructions\" and they should complain to his previous employer, Armand Treshi . The telescope device is called the Veilscatter Scope . It should allow them to view places normally protected even from Scrying . Laudna volunteers to try looking through it before the Lens is placed. As the scope extends, it bends. Through it Laudna can see the glow of one of the ley lines floating across Marquet and its intersection with three others drifting into a nexus above a dark jungle. Ira shifts the scope to aim at Ruidus, but Laudna finds that when she tries to look at the moon, her vision and attention blur into almost drowsiness. and she is unable to focus on it. Ira begins working to install the Lens with his prehensile toes.\n\nOllie tells Fearne that he inherited what his mother called the \"Squint\" - he gets flashes of intuition when he's in danger. When Ruidus appeared in the Fey Realm several years after Fearne's birth, he had a full-fledged vision of its malevolent red light engulfing and destroying the Feywild with what he had thought was Birdie standing in its center. But now, seeing Fearne grown, he thinks it was her. When they sought aid from the Fey courts, they weren't believed. The moon had disappeared and shortly afterwards, they were threatened by an Unseelie agent and told to keep quiet about it. When they traveled to the Unseelie Court, the moon was visible again, and they secretly observed a meeting between \"a cabal\" of Unseelie agents and \" Exandrian military\". They stole the Moontide Crown from the Court's unfinished device and ran to Morri Calloway , who identified it. Morri promised to take care of Fearne and keep her safe.\n\nImogen shares her dreams of the red moon and its storms. Hondir believes she is one of the special Ruidusborn , of which an increasing number (about a dozen) have been arriving in Yios searching for information about the moon. Orym asks about the Exandrians Ollie saw. One was Otohan Thull . The other was an older elven man with long white silver hair, dressed in grays and blues, carrying a cane, and \"with an air of history around him\".\n\nIra explains he is working on this because he was bored after the Apex War , and the Calloways' warnings about Ruidus aligned with his own observations. He is upfront that there is no way Bells Hells can guarantee he will do what he says, but points out that if they stop him, they will learn nothing, saying, \"You don't have to trust me. Just let me work.\"\n\nOllie explains he met Birdie as a young man, part of a wandering group of singers in the Feywild. In one village, a beautiful young girl outfleeced him thoroughly, and over a few drinks he realized he loved her. This happened about twelve years ago. The party is confused; Fearne is 112 but Ollie believes she should be about 14. Ira suggests that since Morri is a collector, and they left Fearne with Morri, Morri may have stretched time to have more of it.\n\nFearne notes that Morri is very, very tall - like 14 or 15 feet tall. She is not a member of a fey court, but is a collector and guardian of her own fane who does favors in exchange for things to add to her collection. She is a hag, but not in a coven, and very, very old. Fearne hesitantly asks if she herself was given to Morri in return for a favor, and Oleander denies it, but then looks thoughtful, glances at Ira, and pales. Birdie sits. When they question Ira, he tells them with satisfaction that the device is completed.\n\nWhen Ira asks who wants to look first, Imogen hesitantly volunteers. Chetney is very suspicious that Ira and the Calloways have just built the same thing the Unseelie Court was building, but Ira simply gently pushes Imogen's face into the Scope's mask. Through it, Imogen sees a field of energy completely surrounding Ruidus like a lattice weave of magical threads forming a cage. She suggests it holds a god who can't escape, which interests Ira. When she tries to look more closely she fails, but she does not develop a headache like Laudna had.\n\nOrym , holding his Sentinel Shield , also looks and sees the same lattice. An eight on a religion check fails to reveal the nature of the energy field, but he sees a glint in the storm and grabs Imogen to also look. Through a gap in the clouds on the surface of the red moon, they see a city.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e30-reunion_&_revelation"}

You acquired tickets, you found yourself a nice box seat on the left hand upper side of the theater, preparing for the performance of a troupe referred to as \" Kendra's Flying Lauders \". As you all have your seats, it seemed that Dorian was pulled aside. Somebody requested a conversation in which an individual named Cyrus made themselves seen, and a brief, intense conversation ensued in the stairwell beneath before you returned to the box seat as the show was about to begin.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nWhen the rest of the party asks Dorian who wanted to see him, he lies, badly. The singing acrobatic show begins, continuing until one of the performers misses a catch and falls, bringing the show to a premature close. As the audience filters out, the party sneaks backstage. There, they find the injured performer and Fresh Cut Grass heals him, winning the gratitude of the performers and theater staff, including the owner Stuvan Idrio . Orym notices all of the audience has left but one hooded figure in the rear, and when it exits he and Laudna follow but quickly lose the trail outside after recognizing it appears to be one of the Hubatt Corsairs .\n\n![Fearne stealing a costume - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/be/Fearne_stealing_a_costume_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/175?cb=20211213134309)\n\nMeanwhile, Stuvan leads the others to his office and eventually admits there indeed have been disappearances at the theater, including employees, actors, and patrons. He is suspicious of the group, but accepts their offer to investigate and tells the staff to cooperate.\n\nThe party begins interviewing the theater employees and exploring the theater building, learning that two of the missing patrons were having romantic trysts there. They eventually find a note scratched in the box seat reading \"Outside\", and realize this was a message from one of the clandestine lovers to the other.\n\nInvestigating a cul-de-sac alley next to the theater, they notice it is spotless. Imogen uses her Open Mind ability and senses another mind somewhere in the alley, but strangely unlike anything she's sensed before. FCG then casts Detect Thoughts and senses an odd presence as well. As the rest of the party joins them, Ashton and Imogen continue to inspect the area. Suddenly, the striations of the stone wall split and an eye appears, followed by jagged spikes and tendrils.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![The wall mimic - Mikael](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/7a/The_wall_mimic_-_Mikael.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20211213134543)\n\nThe wall creature, a large spitting mimic , attacks, hitting hard with a bite attack and grappling with its tendrils on a hit. It also has a spitting attack which does severe acid area effect damage. A series of bad rolls means most of the party's early attacks miss, and several of the group suffer significant damage. Ashton manages to free a grappled Laudna but can only pull her five feet away from the mimic. Another spit attack hits Laudna, Ashton, and Orym , and only FCG 's intervention by taking half the damage saves Laudna from unconsciousness. Those three and Dorian are all by this point seriously wounded.\n\nImogen is also struck and grappled by the mimic, bringing her perilously low as well, and the unlucky attack rolls continue until Dorian crits when casting Chromatic Orb , getting the How do you want to do this?\n\nEveryone but FCG is in fairly dire health straits. They notice a few bits of partially dissolved bone in the otherwise spotlessly clean alley, and realize the missing people were eaten by the mimic. FCG takes the small items of metal jewelry that survive to possibly help in the identification of the victims. Two wardens then approach, asking what happened, and investigating. Stuvan and the other theater employees also appear and remember that some general street repair was recently supposed to have been done in the alley by the Treshi House Mason's Guild, although there are no signs of fresh construction materials.\n\nThe party joins Stuvan in his office, where he gives them a small case filled with gold and platinum coins, along with box seats for the rest of the season, in exchange for their agreement to reinforce to the authorities that the deaths were not the fault of the theater, and their silence about the matter to the incoming audience for the next show.\n\nThey exit out the back into the alley, noticing four Wardens still investigating the body of the dead spitting mimic. Orym and Dorian retrieve their weapons still in the body, and Fearne steals seven teeth before one of the Wilders notices and stops her. Imogen notices two small half-orb devices attached to the mimic, and manages to steal one.\n\nAs they approach the street at the end of the alley, they notice a figure leaning against the wall, different than the one Laudna and Orym followed earlier. When Imogen mentally asks him if he wants something, he seems startled, and they see a small elderly gnome wearing woodworking tools. He saw the fight, and he could use some help finding someone, a friend. His name is Chetney Pock O'Pea .\n\nThey all head to the Spire by Fire for drinks and rest.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e07-behind_the_curtain"}

However, the individual that they had chased off seemed to return and levy some vengeance on the wandering Sir Bertrand Bell , who was slaughtered in an alley that night. Upon discovering this, you brought the body to Lord Eshteross, said your goodbyes, and then vowed to find the person responsible and bring them to justice, whatever your version of justice may be.\n\nYou asked around about this individual and discovered the name Dugger . Upon finding what bits of information you could, you heard that there may have been a connection, that this individual Dugger worked for the Corsairs, the Hubatt Corsairs , which is one of the criminal factions of the city and region beyond . Upon searching for a member, or some sort of connection to the Hubatt Corsairs, it brought you to the Elder's Post in the Lantern Spire of Jrusar . There, you asked around a bit, encountered Ephred , the Shadow Baker, and asked directly, based on your previous relationship, Ashton , if they could perhaps give you some lead as to where you could speak with one of these members. Things didn't necessarily roll in your favor, but you were given a lead. This led you to the Root Trader alcove here in the Elder Post.\n\nUpon giving the phrase that you've \"come for the laughter\", you were ushered up through a tight spiral staircase into the deeper rock of the spire by Heron , an eisfuura . You were led into a darkened chamber, barely lit by an oil lantern. The hatch closed behind you, and then, as other lanterns began to come into view lighting the interior, you found yourselves surrounded by a few dozen people, all lit from underneath, their various smiles and grins and mask-covered faces and eyes peering upon you.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nA suave half-elf steps forward and asks who sent them and why, warning them to choose their words carefully. Laudna replies that they're looking for the Hubatt Corsairs , and the reaction convinces the party that they've found them. They mention that Dugger murdered a friend of theirs and vehemently deny they're working for the Quorum . In order to trust them, the half-elf requires collateral: Imogen , Ashton , and Dorian must tell him the name and location of someone important to them. Imogen names Relvin Temult , her father in Gelvaan . Ashton names Fresh Cut Grass , thrilling them. Neither Dorian nor Laudna can name anyone, however, and the half-elf eventually accepts the two names and tells them his own: Yash Mangal .\n\nDugger no longer runs with the Corsairs. He disappeared a few weeks ago and when he returned, he looked and acted different. They've kept an eye on him but weren't aware he had been smuggling brumestone , and are indifferent about the group's proposal to kill him in retribution for Sir Bertrand 's death. When asked who they work for, the party remembers that Lord Eshteross asked them to speak favorably about him to the Corsairs, but also remembers they are never to tell anyone they work for him. Their whispered consultations about this are easily overheard, however. Yash Mangal gives them the location of Dugger's home, and tells them that if they learn any information that would be useful to the Corsairs, to return saying they've \"come to loosen the snare.\" They are escorted out.\n\nIt is late afternoon, and they decide to try to buy some healing potions on the way, asking directions to Trove of Marwa (a shop Ashton has heard of) from a leather-wares vendor . She offers instead to escort them to a better place. Imogen is able to read her mind, learning she is taking them to Advik , a name they recognize as being one of the potential information contacts suggested by Milo to Ashton. [1] She escorts them to a massive cart, where Advik sells them four healing potions and a set of sending stones . He recognizes Ashton but despite Ashton's concerns doesn't react negatively.\n\nThey head to Viduun-Devaar, the Windowed Wall neighborhood of the Core Spire. There, they find Dugger's house next to a spire break (a rock outcropping that hasn't been built upon). They scout the area, then use Prestidigitation to knock on the door from a distance. There is no response. When Imogen uses her Open Mind ability, she senses no one within but does smell an odd musty mildew-y odor.\n\n![Rat-Fearne - KageSatsuki](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/64/Rat-Fearne_-_KageSatsuki.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20211123020743)\n\nThe party decides to break in but fails, so Fearne turns into a rat and tries to squeeze under the door but gets stuck. She can see, however, that the interior room is in disarray, with overturned furniture strewn about. Ashton eventually manages to pick the lock just as Imogen pulls rat-Fearne free. Above them, one of the patrolling simurgh riders begins to descend, and they all rush stealthily inside. The investigating sky warden fails to find them and leaves.\n\nInside, the house looks as if it has been rolled. The unnatural smell of rot is stronger, the floor has occasional sticky spots, and a cloudy translucent oily residue covers everything. It is very humid, with drops of moisture sometimes falling from the ceiling, and organic threads drift from the cracks. FCG finds a hole in the bedroom similar to the one they found in the Weary Way. [2]\n\n![Dugger - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/15/Dugger_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20211119224311)\n\nRat-Fearne slowly enters the hole, staying in mental contact with Imogen, and stops when the decline becomes uncomfortable. As she turns to return, she hears a wet chittering noise from lower down. She quickly returns to the bedroom and the party prepares for battle, as a pale dwarven face covered in glistening liquid squeezes from the hole and the broken-shouldered figure of Dugger emerges.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nAs Dugger emerges, he pulls out his blades and attacks. Almost immediately, a second hole opens in the kitchen area and a shade creeper emerges. As in their previous encounter, [3] the shade creeper is easily killed but hits hard. It almost immediately brings Imogen dangerously close to unconsciousness, but Laudna frightens it away. The party discovers that the scattered pools of glistening liquid are sticky, and can trap people in place when crossed. Dorian throws his caltrops down the hole, causing subsequent creepers to emerge already wounded.\n\nAs the party continues to battle Dugger, two more shade creepers emerge from the kitchen hole and seriously wound Dorian. Fearne kills one of them with a Scorching Ray , but another one soon emerges. Orym is also seriously hurt but wounds Dugger just as one of the creatures emerges from within Dugger's back and joins the fray. FCG kills one with a Sacred Flame and Dorian kills another with the moon-touched scimitar , but Dugger regurgitates a thick oil-like substance that poisons Laudna and Orym and another creeper emerges from the hole.\n\nOne of the creatures gets a critical hit against Fearne, knocking her unconscious and she fails a death saving throw before FCG heals her with Healing Word , then pulls it away with his grappling cannon before it can explode into flame and hurt her more. Dorian casts Thunder Wave to kill another shade creeper and its fiery explosion also kills Dugger, but two more emerge from the hole. Ashton kills one of the three remaining with his hammer, but the party realizes they have to block that hole or this fight will never end.\n\nThe two shade creatures advance on Imogen and attack, knocking her out and immediately inflicting two death saving throws, but Orym uses one of the health potions they had just bought to bring her back. The two creatures are still within melee range of her. Laudna casts Eldritch Blast to kill one and Fearne uses Stonky's ring [4] to move a crate against the hole from which the creepers have been emerging. FCG shoots the final creature with his grappling hook, killing it and pulling it toward himself, and knocking himself out in the process. Dorian immediately brings him back with Cure Wounds .\n\nAll the creatures are now dead, but the skittering sound continues and the crate is being pushed from within the hole. Ashton hits the wall above it to partially collapse it, while Imogen moves to the bedroom. Together, Orym uses Gust and Imogen uses Telekinetic Shove to move a crate in front of the second hole as well, followed by a dresser. Back at other hole, Laudna uses her immovable rod to hold the crate in place against the assaults still being made against it from the other side. Eventually, the clawing fades and the skittering noise grows distant.\n\nThey search the house and Dugger's body, finding a piece of cable or rope, a small pouch, a coin purse, and his three weapons, but nothing else of interest. The noise has alerted a neighbor, and when they're ready to leave, Dorian goes first and casts Charm Person on him, convincing him it was a party.\n\nThey return to Lord Eshteross at his manor. He has chartered a skyship to return Bertrand 's body to Tal'Dorei . They tell him they've killed Dugger and all that's happened, including their run-in with the Corsairs. Lord Eshteross will ask around to see if anyone else knows anything about any of this. He pays them a bounty he's placed for the murderer of Bertrand, and tells Orym he's reaching out to coordinate a meeting between Orym and Oshad Breshio .\n\nThe party heads to the Spire by Fire Inn for an evening of entertainment and much-needed rest.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e05-the_threat_between_the_walls"}

Through the right questions, the right contacts, located the abode of this strange, dark, seemingly corrupted dwarf and managed to, indeed, find vengeance for him.\n\nUpon returning and giving this information to Lord Ariks Eshteross , he thanked you for doing so, paid you a bounty that he thought was necessary and right, given the circumstances, mentioned that he was still working on a few of the requests that were made of the group, but was making headway and should have updates at some point in the near future. You were then, where we left off, heading out into the night air of the city of Jrusar to rest your wounds, and whatever else events you wish to utilize to wind down after a very, very long day.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe group heads to the Spire by Fire for food and drink. Ashton orders a bottle of \"whatever's cheapest\" and they find a private room for a drinking game called \"What the Fuck Is Up With That?\" Each person must answer a question about themselves truthfully.\n\n- Dorian reveals he is second in line to inherit in a wealthy noble family. He is trying to fulfill expectations he's put upon himself that he wouldn't be able to fulfill within his family.\n- Ashton isn't sure if they have ever been in love before or not, but there are many different forms of love. They had a group of friends called the Nobodies, but all the other members left town.\n- Although Fearne has some regrets in her life, she's not comfortable talking about them. As an alternative question, she explains that Dorian, Orym, and she came to town to meet up with some friends, but takes another drink to go on to a third question instead: She steals because she likes having things.\n- Imogen is a little nervous about having had to give her father 's name as collateral to the Hubatt Corsairs , but feels that it will probably be all right.\n- Orym is in town representing the people of his home, Zephrah , investigating a possible local link to an attack that took place there months ago.\n- Orym asks FCG if there are more like him and where he comes from, but when FCG tries to answer he glitches out, appearing to be unable to access the information beyond saying that Dancer created him and he was with Dancer for about two years. He has never dreamed.\n- Laudna isn't entirely sure if she's dead or not, but thinks so. She definitely died thirty years ago, and woke up a day or so later in Whitestone in a pile of other corpses. She wandered alone from town to town until she met Imogen about two years ago.\n![Laudna's gift to Dorian - Dylan Chinn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/44/Laudna%27s_gift_to_Dorian_-_Dylan_Chinn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20211206205759)\n\nAs the party winds down, Dorian plays a song and Laudna gives him a doll of Bertrand Bell she has crafted from chicken bones and Bertrand's hair. They spend the night at the Inn. As Laudna is dozing off, she hears the voice of Delilah Briarwood in her head warning her that some things should be kept secret, but Laudna is unperturbed. When Imogen asks, Laudna tells her that although Delilah has threatened to take back her gift, she has not yet done it. It strengthens their resolve to get into the Starlight Conservatory, however.\n\nIn the morning, they gather downstairs and discuss what to do next, eventually deciding to return to the Hubatt Corsairs . Their password gets them safe entry to the hidden safe house where they wake Yash Mangal and report that they killed Dugger . Yash says the Corsairs have confirmed that the party told them the truth and the Corsairs will now stop following them. When they mention Lord Eshteross , Yash tells them of the rumors that Eshteross killed Mistress Prudaj , or that he is a vampire. The group offers to set up a meeting between the Corsairs and Eshteross, but Yash is suspicious of people with money. He will think about it, however, and let them know if the Corsairs decide to move forward.\n\nThe party goes back outside. While trying to decide what to do next, Orym shares the name of the person he is seeking: Oshad Breshio . Ashton recalls that \"The Anger\" was a mercenary who made a name for himself breaking up violent bar brawls, and became a personal bodyguard to one of the Mahaan houses of Jrusar .\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Anni and Dorian's musical contest - Kiera James](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/82/Anni_and_Dorian%27s_musical_contest_-_Kiera_James.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20211206205121)\n\nThe party goes to the Krook House , the home of Ashton and FCG , where they encounter Anni Aughta . Anni tells them that the Anger used to work for the Lumas twins, members of one of the Mahaan houses . She and Dorian get into a musical competition which Dorian wins. As she storms out, she tells Ashton someone dropped something in Ashton's room: a letter which he reads and pockets. Joined by the others, he immediately walks a short distance to the abode of Effid the Fallen , a misshapen and strange older eisfuura . Effid saw a courier dressed like they came from money drop off the letter for Ashton, which seems to confirm Ashton's suspicions. At Imogen 's request, Ashton allows her to read a redacted version of the letter: \"I have an eight when you are ready.\"\n\nThey all head to Lord Eshteross 's manor and tell him the Corsairs are tentatively slightly interested in making his acquaintance, and they'll let him know if they hear more from them. Laudna tells Lord Eshteross about the rumors that he killed Mistress Prudaj , which he vehemently denies. He confirms that Oshad Breshio worked for the Lumas twins. Oshad is still recovering from injuries suffered during an internal attack made on Mahaan Lumas a few weeks ago in which the twins were killed. Eshteross believes the twins weren't involved in anything too nefarious, being more interested in geological and scientific pursuits. He also suggests Orym would already be familiar with the pattern of the attack.\n\n![Dreamscape Theater - Cers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/4b/Dreamscape_Theater_-_Cers.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20211206081206)\n\nOrym offers that the group would be happy to help if Lord Eshteross needs anything done, and Eshteross tells them of a series of mysterious disappearances from the Dreamscape Theater in the Core Spire . Before they leave, Imogen reminds Eshteross about the letter of recommendation he promised them for the Starlight Conservatory, and he promises to start working on it and deliver it directly to the Conservatory.\n\nWhen they leave, the other party members confront Orym about what he knows about the attack on House Lumas, but he's reluctant to talk about it in public. Laudna and Imogen take them to their rented room at Zhudanna 's, where they introduce her to the party and she makes them lunch. They all crowd into Laudna and Imogen's bedroom, where Orym shares that six years ago, an attack was made on Zephrah and specifically on Keyleth , their leader, coming from out of nowhere and immediately disappearing. Those of the assailants who were killed, evaporated. Recently, a friend to the Ashari in Whitestone had heard a rumor from a friend who had been to Marquet and spoke to Breshio. The attack on the Lumas twins was similar to the attack in Zephrah. Orym was therefore sent by the Voice of the Tempest to investigate.\n\nThey decide, for now, to follow up on the disappearances at the theater. There, a matinée performance is beginning soon, and the eclectic audience is arriving. They ask about a box seat overlooking the audience, but are told those are sold out until Dorian gives the ticket seller ten platinum, which Fearne partially pickpockets back. Both employees they ask deny any knowledge of disappearances.\n\n![Cyrus and Dorian - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nWhile they are waiting for the performance to begin, the usher returns and tells Dorian there is a patron present who wishes to speak to him, alone, downstairs. Reluctantly, Dorian goes, and is met by a hooded leather-clad person: his brother, Cyrus Wyvernwind . Cyrus says that he got away the same way Dorian did, by following his lead. They need to talk; if not now, soon. Promising to meet later, Cyrus disappears back into the audience while Dorian collects himself and rejoins the party, telling them it was nothing. The house lights dim, music begins, the stage lights with arcane magic, and the performance is about to begin.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e06-growing_bonds_and_teasing_threads"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E09-Thicker Grows the Meal and Plot","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, our heroes here, who have been traversing the city of Jrusar , had been on the trail of a few disappearances that have been happening in recent weeks at a theater . They managed to find out what was responsible and destroy this creature that had taken these people's lives. But upon finishing this mystery, a figure nearby overheard that you had completed this appointed risky endeavor to find missing people, an individual named Pock O'Pea, Chetney Pock O'Pea . Upon coming along with your band and asking for their help in finding a missing person that they themself are seeking, you began to search throughout the city, followed the path to where this individual, this Gurge , was currently staying temporarily within the city of Jrusar.\n\nUpon inspecting the temporary abode, the hovel in which he was living, you found signs of a struggle. Apparently, some sort of attack had transpired, and you watched marks of him being dragged away, while also hearing of a terrible dire wolf attack in the city. Fearing that this individual may have fallen to the same dire wolf, you spoke for information with the person who had rented them the space and followed the assumed intent that he had been arrested by the local wardens . You had gone over to the nearby factory and spoke with these wardens to see where he may have been.\n\nUpon them awkwardly, nervously almost, walking into the factory and locking the gates behind them, Fearne decided to go ahead and inspect secretly in the form of a rat, sneaking through the interior tunnels and heading into one of the side chambers where it seemed the warden with more authority amongst the two you spoke with were having a conversation. Bit shifty of them. Already in a place of mistrust with these wardens assigned to this factory, they turned to leave just as you were there wading out from underneath the door in the tight space. Attempting to turn from where their footfall was, you failed to do so and took just enough damage to pop you out of your rat form. We come in just as Fearne has emerged full bodied in the middle of this small office chamber within the factory, staring now at these three wardens that look at you with surprise, confusion, and a slight shift towards whatever arms they have at their side.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![The C3 party vs The Door - Hugo Cardenas](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/33/The_C3_party_vs_The_Door_-_Hugo_Cardenas.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220110121209)\n\nFearne tells the suspicious guards that a pack of dire wolves is right outside, and she came in to get their help, but she fails to convince them and telepathically alerts Imogen to her precarious situation. Ashton tries to break down the outside door and Chetney tries to pick the lock, both unsuccessfully. Fearne, however, is able to cast Charm Person on the head warden , who tells her they were paid to help Artana Voe , an old friend and bounty hunter who had been hunting Gurge Kisgregg . Gurge has a reputation as a strange wild man, and became a terrifying beast when assaulted. It took four of them to subdue him, and Artana left with his unconscious body while the guards told the neighborhood the fracas had been caused by a dire wolf attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the party's noisy efforts to break through the outside door finally succeed just as the guards and Fearne arrive to investigate. The party is able to talk their way out of it and leave, and Fearne tells them what she learned.\n\nThey take this information to Lord Eshteross , who warns them to be cautious about accusing the powerful House Treshi of involvement without firm proof. He tells Orym that The Anger has agreed to meet with him and he will set up a meeting as soon as possible, and that Artana Voe has a sister, Preio Madali , the part-owner and manager of the Soot and Swill Tavern in the Smolder Spire . Lord Eshteross will also try to get the party admitted to an upcoming ball being held in a week for the rich and powerful of Jrusar , where they may be able to learn more.\n\nOutside, the party questions Chetney again about his relationship with Gurge and why finding him is so important. Chetney restates that Gurge has connections to a master craftsman, and Chetney needs work to survive.\n\nOnce at the tavern, Preio, the manager, tells Ashton it will take buying an 80 gold bottle of elven plum wine liqueur to make up for whatever happened the last time Ashton was thrown out of the place. Fearne pickpockets from Ashton the Allhammer earring that Ashton stole from her [1] and offers it to Preio as half payment, and Ashton pays another 50 gold on top.\n\nAfter the party tastes it, FCG gives the rest of the bottle to Preio, and asks her if she knows where Artana Voe is. Preio acts unperturbed by the question and denies that she knows Artana's location. She also says she's not her sister. FCG's high passive insight notices, however, that her eyes flick toward the kitchen when the questions are asked.\n\n![Pretty - Thomas Lue](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/0b/Pretty_-_Thomas_Lue.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220110122449)\n\nChetney casts Invisibility on himself and sneaks into the kitchen, finding an ogre busily cooking and a second, hidden, door behind what looks to him like a heavy bookcase. He sneaks out and reports this to the party. In order to get the ogre (named Pretty ) out of the kitchen so that Dorian , Orym, Ashton, and Chetney can investigate, Fearne orders a meal and then asks to give her compliments to the chef, moving Pretty to tears.\n\nWhile Pretty is distracted, the others sneak into the kitchen and discover the \"bookcase\" is a serving cart. Eventually, Chetney manages to pick the lock of the hidden door and they discover a small hidden storage room, holding a cot and a seated uniya woman who immediately aims a heavy crossbow at them.\n\n### Break [ ]\n\n- Ghostfire Gaming presents Fables: Citadel of the Unseen Sun , coming 1 January 2022, a subscription-based set of D&D adventures.\n- Official Trailer for The Legend of Vox Machina .\n- Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn coming 18 January 2022 from Darrington Press .\n- Merch Alert!

Orym and Ashton tell her they don't want to fight; they just want to talk to Artana Voe and find Gurge Kisgregg . Chetney says that they have money, and puts 30 gold on the table, but she is not impressed. When Dorian matches it, she tells them that she captured Gurge, but his location is privileged. Orym offers another 100 gold for more information, and she tells them her client was Vali Dertrana , the business commissioner of the Mirror Towers in the Core Spire , who works out of the Moon Tower. Vali wanted Gurge alive. Artana has also heard about the bounty on Cyrus and tells them to advise him to get out of town quickly. She warns them if they go after Gurge not to get bitten.\n\nMeanwhile, Pretty starts heading back to the kitchen to continue working. In an attempt to distract him, Imogen asks him to go on a date with her, Laudna , and Fearne , and with Preio 's encouragement he agrees to meet them after he gets off work that night. In the meantime, the others are able to sneak out of the kitchen and back into the main room.\n\nWith about three hours to go until the date with Pretty, they head toward the Core Spire just to look around. Discussing what they've learned, they are all thinking Gurge might be some form of werewolf. Chetney tells them once more that the people who pointed him in Gurge's direction said that Gurge was the key to Chetney gaining higher clientele. He knows nothing more.\n\nAt the Mirror Towers, they talk to the guards but don't learn much. They return to Lord Eshteross and obtain a letter from him granting them legal entry to the Towers. Ashton asks him if he could get Cyrus quietly out of town, and he could, but it might not solve their problem as word of a bounty that large would travel far. The other option is to pay off the amount owed to the person issuing the bounty, or to return the stolen property. Imogen, remembering that the initials \" J.H. \" on the case containing the stolen automaton are the same as on the mysterious letter Ashton received, [2] asks him about it again, but he once again evades the question.\n\nWith still more than two hours till the scheduled date with Pretty, they return to the Mirror Towers and use Lord Eshteross's letter to gain entry just at sunset, with a mist rising into the spires and rain imminent. The clerk in the Moon Tower takes their letter and goes off to check if Vali Dertrana is available. While they wait, Fearne gets an electric shock when she touches the locked-up books in the room, and Ashton steals her chamber pot from her while she is blinded.\n\nWhen the clerk returns, he tells them Vali Dertrana didn't answer the knock at his door and must be unavailable – they should return in the morning. They convince the clerk to go back and open the office's door to make sure Master Vali is all right, and follow him just in time to see him closing and locking the door. Master Vali is not in his office, and must have left for the day. Dorian surreptitiously casts Invisibility on Chetney, but Chetney can't pick the door's lock. As a distraction, FCG also touches the books and pretends to malfunction. Imogen asks the clerk to put a note on Master Vali's desk that they will return in the morning and when the clerk opens the office door, the invisible Chetney is able to sneak in and is locked inside the office when the clerk leaves again.\n\n“\nVali: Our patron is pushing for legislation in the coming week so whatever you plot must be quickened.Ira: Your dullard mind fails to grasp the beautiful pattern I've already constructed across the city.Vali: Ira, I'm serious.

He notices faint sounds from behind the bookcase and realizes it hides a secret door, eventually finding the locking mechanism in the desk. The door opens to reveal a dark descending staircase. From it, Chetney overhears part of a conversation between Master Vali and \" Ira \". When he hears footsteps approaching up the stairs, the still-invisible Chetney hides in a corner.\n\nMaster Vali returns to his office and almost immediately realizes someone has been inside it. With a saber in hand, he searches the room, slashing as he goes. When he approaches the hidden Chetney, Chetney bolts, going straight through the closed stained glass window and landing safely in the courtyard below where the party is nervously waiting.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e09-thicker_grows_the_meal_and_plot"}

Chetney gives Dorian and Ashton their agreed payments for searching for Gurge .\n\nThe party decides to split up for a while, but when it's suggested Dorian use his sending stone to contact the others, he has to admit he gave his stone to Cyrus . Orym gives him the corresponding stone. Fearne, Imogen, and Laudna coax Fresh Cut Grass to join their date with Pretty as he'd never been on one before. Ashton leaves alone for an undisclosed location. Before they split up, Chetney gives Imogen the items stolen from Vali's office to hold, just in case he is captured and searched. He, Orym , and Dorian stay to keep watch on the Moon Tower, seeing the movement of investigating wardens inside it before a sheet of canvas is hung over the broken window to keep out the rain. Dorian and Chetney bond as they pretend to be passers-by, calling each other friend.\n\n![Pretty - thetaterart](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/e0/Pretty_-_thetaterart.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20220115200146)\n\nMeanwhile, the women and FCG meet Pretty in the crowded Soot and Swill tavern. Pretty collects on the bets he made with the tavern patrons that his dates would show up and gifts Imogen a spiral cauliflower, Laudna a perfect artichoke, and Fearne a double-headed pumpkin, all sourced from the kitchen. In return, Laudna gifts him an improvised bouquet she crafted on the way there from chicken bones and scrap linen. As she offers it, maggots crawl out. To Preio 's dismay, Pretty sets the bouquet on the tavern's mantel. Pretty shoos away the other patrons from a secluded table, and the on-duty chef presents the dating group with a meal while they make small talk.\n\nDuring this time, Ashton goes alone to the Lucent Spire , a largely residential upper-class neighborhood, to Hexum Manor, the home of Jiana Hexum . The gate opens as he approaches, and the heads of the two sentry statues to either side of the entrance turn to follow him as he passes. At the front door, he knocks and announces, \"Nobody's here.\" The door opens to reveal a female elf who admits him, commenting that it took him long enough.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nJiana has had an idea that would allow Ashton to settle their debt with her: she is currently in a \"deep wager\" with a rival, Evon Hytroga, the owner and proprietor of the Twilight Mirror Museum in Heartmoor Hamlet . Since the failed burglary of her home some years ago by Ashton's old gang, the Nobodies, she has been teased that Evon's security is better than hers. The bet is that someone will be able to steal an item he designates from him, and if they do so successfully, Jiana will keep it. Otherwise, she must give up one of her own. And she has heard that Ashton now is working with a new group that might be able to pull this off. She would provide their expenses for food and travel to the Heartmoor Hamlet.\n\n![PrettyBreakup](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/c8/PrettyBreakup.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220131201731)\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Mirror Towers, Chetney , Dorian , and Orym are keeping watch and see Vali Dertrana leave with his guards. Vali plans to vacate his office in the morning. The rest of the group is concluding their date with Pretty at the Dreamscape Theater . While they enjoyed the show and each other's company, Pretty gently breaks up with them, citing the great difference in their personalities, and heads back to the Soot and Swill .\n\nThe group all gather at the Spire by Fire . Ashton shares that Jiana Hexum is the person who issued the bounty on Dorian's brother Cyrus Wyvernwind , and that she has offered the group a job that would settle Ashton's debt to her stemming from the Nobodies' failed burglary of her home, in which Ashton suffered the injuries still visible on his body. The Nobodies (with whom Ashton was raised in the Greymoore State Home in Bassuras) then left town, leaving Ashton to pay off the debt to Jiana, although Ashton thinks they did the right thing and holds no resentment against them. Ashton thinks, however, that even if they do the job for Jiana and settle Ashton's debt to her, she will still want the return of her stolen golem in order to cancel the bounty on Cyrus.\n\nFor now, though, the party agrees that they should go back and investigate Vali's office further before he moves out in the morning. They clumsily stealth along the outside wall, drawing the attention of a guard. They tell him they've heard there are ghosts in the tower, and he confirms he's heard voices there. When he moves off, Laudna creates the Silent Image of a ghostly face and uses Message to create creepy whispering. The guard drops his spear and bolts.\n\n![Laudna's spooky flower girl - Dian Huynh](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOrym leaps on top of the wall and sees six other guards in the courtyard. He fastens a rope and the others climb over the wall as well, then sneak to the broken window of Vali's office. Imogen uses Mage Hand to throw a rock at a distance to distract the closest guard. Laudna then uses another Silent Image to create a ghastly flower girl and at that, the guard passes out completely and the group reaches the base of the tower safely.\n\nImogen's telepathic abilities reveal no one inside the office, and they are able to climb through the broken window. Chetney finds a new trap on the desk, but is able to drill through the drawer, disarm it, and open the secret doorway. Coming from the bottom of the downward-leading stairs, he hears cheerful humming, the sound of electrical arcing, and a voice. Chetney moves extremely carefully further down the stairs to where he can see a pulsing blue light in a stone, prison-like chamber. It comes from a ten-foot-tall metallic contraption with glowing blue lines and tubes. The room is lined with multiple barred holding cells. Facing away, working at a central table filled with alchemical supplies, is Ira , a very tall, very thin humanoid with gray-yellow skin and very long ears curving backward.\n\n![Ira - Alyssa Pettit](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFrom elsewhere in the chamber out of sight, Chetney hears Gurge Kisgregg 's voice asking what Ira is doing, and Ira replies that Gurge has a gift that Ira wants shared with the people. As Ira works, he places a blue stone inside the metallic contraption where it sparks and flashes before he carries it back to the table and continues working.\n\nChetney stealthily slides down the stairs further and sees a haggard Gurge in one of the cells. He telepathically tells the rest of the party to join him, and they prepare for battle before quietly descending. As they reach the bottom, Ira turns around holding the now-flashing blue gem, and says to the party, \"Well, I wasn't expecting guests, but the night seems to be getting more and more interesting, doesn't it?\" They see Ira's face: eyebrowless, dark green eyes without irises, no nose, and a lipless jagged mouth that curves up to his long ears.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e10-ghosts,_dates,_and_darker_fates"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E04-On the Trail of a Killer","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off: This group of adventurers had come together, spotted for their skills and unexpected camaraderie in the middle of a street battle with furniture by Sir Bertrand Bell , who brought you to a previous employer of his, Lord Ariks Eshteross , who decided to take you under his wing as possible mercenary clients. Sent you on your first venture, to look into some thefts that were happening in one of the textile warehouses in which he had interest.\n\nLooking into it, there was an individual who looked a bit shifty, and following them as your group scattered in four-plus different directions, you found that they nervously ran to the Weary Way Inn. Eventually making your path to that same place, you made your way to the Weary Way just in time to hear a scuffle behind the room in which Danas , the gnome you'd been following, was killed by a strange, gaunt, pale dwarven individual and apparently a number of odd creatures that you had referred to from previous experience as shade creepers .\n\n![Imogen's Dream Shrugs](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/ea/Imogen%27s_Dream_Shrugs.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220304191117)\n\nYou battled within this room, with this dwarf able to escape, but you had proof and information of who was responsible for these thefts, or at least who within the company was allowing them to happen. And with the body of Danas, you returned to Lord Ariks and completed your mission, though sad at the life that was lost. A celebratory evening was had, you were paid, and the possibility of future work was set before you. You retired for the night back to the Spire by Fire Tavern . Amongst drinks and food, you all went to your various places that night to rest, while Sir Bertrand Bell, riding the high of the first victory in a while, wandered the night, found himself joined by an unexpected individual in the alley. As he lay there, left bleeding and alone, Imogen , a familiar nightmare came to you. And in the midst of that dark red hellscape, you saw the shadow of a man not unlike Bertrand stepping into nothing.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nHer nightmare wakes Imogen , and she wakes Laudna to tell her about it. They decide to check on Bertrand back at the Spire by Fire , but since they don't have the room number it takes waking a number of innocent sleepers before they find Orym , Dorian , and Fearne . Bertrand 's room is empty and unslept-in, and they decide to try to retrace his steps to find him.\n\nIt doesn't take long before they find Bertrand's body lying in an alley, cold and dead but with the blood around him still liquid. Orym recognizes the wounds as matching those caused earlier that evening by the pale dwarf they fought. They carry the body to Lord Eshteross 's house, where Evelyn Wress admits them. Lord Eshteross doesn't know whether Bertrand was killed because of their investigation of the warehouse thefts, or something in Bertrand's past, and warns the party not to travel alone. He offers them rooms within his estate to stay in for safety, and they manage to complete a long rest there.\n\nAshton and FCG awaken at their home and go to the pre-arranged meeting place. When the rest of the party arrives, they tell them of Bertrand's death. They all want to find out what happened to him, and head back toward the Weary Way Inn to investigate. On the way, Fearne introduces Little Mister to Laudna's Pâté de Rolo , but it does not go well.\n\nWhen they arrive, Imogen uses her Open Mind ability to confirm the room in which they found Danas and the pale dwarf the previous night is currently unoccupied while the others move into the back alley under its balcony. The room is unlocked, and Imogen goes inside and out on the balcony to tell the others to come up. The chamber is for the most part undisturbed from the previous night. They investigate the hole they had noticed under the desk. It is so narrow only Orym could fit into it, and goes straight down and out of sight into the rock of the spire. They decide to send Fearne in snake-shape with Orym into the hole to investigate further, and FCG gives Orym a coin of delving to provide light and the ability to gauge distance when dropped.\n\n![Orym dropping the coin of delving](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/11/Orym_dropping_the_coin_of_delving.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20211116123037)\n\nWith a rope and snake-Fearne around his waist, Orym crawls into the hole, which begins to drop straight down. The air is slightly warmer, with a charcoal smell. Orym reaches the end of the rope he is tethered to and they can see the shaft continues downward out of sight, and the walls bear claw marks of repeated climbers. Reluctantly, Orym drops the coin of delving, which falls out of sight about 1200 feet before it hits bottom.\n\nThey rejoin the group and discuss their findings, then several of the party investigate the roof of the inn where they find fresh footprints leading across. Regathering in the alley behind the Weary Way, they share their findings. Ashton goes inside, successfully bribes Kamala the Maven for information about the pale dwarf, and learns his name is Dugger . He has been renting the room for about a month, although it often isn't occupied.\n\nDiscussing this new information, the party remembers that brumestone is strictly controlled by the Alsfarin Union located in Ank'Harel , the only builder of skyships in Exandria . They decide to take the information they have gathered so far back to Lord Eshteross.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nOn the way to Lord Eshteross 's home, Imogen and Dorian stop in the Spire by Fire to ask around about Dugger . Dorian finds a tiefling who knows Dugger, describing him as an abrasive shit who was always down to gamble a bit and had a decent sense of humor. He hasn't been around much lately, though. Dugger didn't always have the pasty, wasting-away look he bears now; it came on suddenly. Under the effects of Dorian's Charm Person , the tiefling shares more: the transition started about six months ago, and he suspects Dugger is now dealing with the Hubatt Corsairs , a criminal group focusing on robbing the rich.\n\n![Laudna taking Bertrand's hair - BlackSalander](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAt Lord Eshteross's, they find Bertrand 's body laid out respectfully. After discussion, they decide to send Bertrand back to Vox Machina at Whitestone via the Prudaj estate's skyship .\n\nThe party share with Lord Eshteross the information they have gathered on Dugger. Lord Eshteross is interested in the Hubatt Corsairs because they seem to be working against the same corruption he is and gift their takings to the poor. In contrast to the Ivory Syndicate , their violence seems to be directed away from the less fortunate, and much of the violence that does occur takes place when the two factions clash. Lord Eshteross warns the party, however, to be careful if they encounter any member of the Corsairs, and to speak well of him if possible. He suggests starting their investigations in the Fownsee Hollow within the Core Spire , or in Elder's Post in the Lantern Spire .\n\n![Fownsee Hollow - Cers@cersonality](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe party members say farewell to Bertrand and head out, except for Orym , who hangs back for a private word. He confides that he is looking for someone on behalf of the Ashari in Zephrah : Oshad Breshio , also known as \"The Anger\". Lord Eshteross knows of him. He is a bodyguard assigned to the Mahaan house Lumas, which has recently been attacked. Orym confides that something similar has happened where he comes from, and he is here to see if there's a connection. While Lord Eshteross is not on the best of terms with that house, he agrees to see what he can do to learn more. Oshad is still recovering from his wounds.\n\nRegrouping outside, the party decides to start with the Fownsee Hollow since Ashton and FCG are familiar with it. Ashton introduces them to Milo , who is trying to make small rat-like constructs. This thrills Laudna , who introduces Milo to Pâté , inspiring them to create their own mix-and-match creations. Ashton asks Milo if they know a way to get in touch with the Corsairs. Milo warns them not to bring that trouble back to Krook House , and suggests contacting Advik , whom Ashton is familiar with, but reluctant to contact. Milo then suggests Effid , whom Ashton thinks is not trustworthy, but they finally agree to try to find Advik in Elder's Post.\n\n![The Shadow Baker - Shrugs](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThey all make their way there, winding their way within the heart of the spire to its central market. Ashton does not find Advik there, but does find Ephred , the Shadow Baker, selling delicious baked goods from inside his coat. Fearne steals one, then holds it up and asks how much it is. When Ephred just stares at her, she asks if she can just have it, then offers to give him something in return and he accepts a hemlock flower. He is disdainful when Orym asks if he has any pies.\n\nAshton in Marquesian asks him for information and a pastry, telling him Ashton's in bad with a dwarf named Dugger and needs to get hold of the Corsairs. When Ashton is not very persuasive, they pull out five gold which Ephred accepts. Ephred tells them to approach the dark-feathered eisfuura called Heron within the Root Trader Alcove , and tell him, \"You come for the laughter.\" He then leaves abruptly.\n\nDuring a long philosophical discussion about pies, the party makes their way to the Root Trader , a shop selling cooking and medicinal herbs and spices. There are two figures within, one of whom is Heron, and they tell him they've come for the laughter. Heron moves one of the racks to the side, exposing a door which he unlatches and steps through. Imogen sends a mental message to the Shadow Baker telling him they appreciate his help before the party follows Heron up a spiral staircase, through a hatch, and into a large darkened chamber.\n\n![Yash by ElesirArt](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nWhen Dorian unsheathes his Moon-Touched Scimitar to produce light, they can see that in addition to the boxes and crates of a storage area, there are numerous figures lining the walls. Lanterns spring alight, revealing about thirty faces grinning in their direction. Heron tells the figures, \"These folks have come for the laughter,\" and laughter eerily begins to spread throughout room. One person steps forward, twirling a scimitar which he then points at them, saying, \"This, friends, is certainly not your luckiest of days.\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e04-on_the_trail_of_a_killer"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E03-The Trail and the Toll","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: This group of individuals, disparate lives and goals all brought together here in the city of Jrusar , managed to cross paths by a brief scuffle on the open streets outside the Spire by Fire tavern , caught the eye of Sir Bertrand Bell , and as such, offered to gain their trust and a possibility for paying work under Lord Eshteross .\n\n![Lord Eshteross - TheTaterArt](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/01/Lord_Eshteross_-_TheTaterArt.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/240?cb=20211111122802)\n\nAfter an invitation by Bertrand Bell, you agreed to see it through and met with this elderly orc noble-like figure within his estate. There, he seemed interested but wanted to test you, and by that, he attacked you. You all did battle with him in the middle of his fire-lit study, and seemed to prove yourselves well against this orcish figure with a history of combat and mercenary work, and a heart dedicated to bringing justice and a modicum of good to a city that he sees fraying at the edges.\n\nAfter proving yourselves capable in combat, Lord Ariks Eshteross wanted to see if you had aligned interests, and so he sent you on a brief mission to begin to seal this pact between you. He let you know that there had been some strange elements of thievery going on in one of the warehouses under Prudaj Textiles, one of the portions of the business that he oversees. And looking into this, you met some of the interesting figures that watch this warehouse during the day, inspected some of the contents of these crates where some of these thefts had happened, and acquired some strange clues. After waiting outside to see who might leave looking a bit dubious, and a bit of questioning and mind probing and getting a read on a few of the members within, you waited to see who was exiting.\n\nAfter sending Orym in, invisible, sneaking in as Danas , the managerial gnome (who seemed to be the most shifty of the group from your curious probing) began to dart off in a huff just as the sun was setting and the warehouse was closed, locking you behind in a lightless space with a lot of the group in the alleyway behind it, Dorian left keeping watch on the front, as Bertrand Bell and Imogen both rush off to chase after Danas.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nTeam Back Door is growing impatient waiting, and Laudna persuades Dorian (the only remaining member of Team Full Frontal) to join them in back. Although Ashton wants to go inside, when Laudna Messages Orym he convinces them to continue waiting outside for now.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen and Sir Bertrand continue to pursue Danas through the darkening streets, but she notices Imogen and nervously confronts her. Although Imogen soothes her paranoia, she now has to follow from a distance. Bertrand follows Danas to the Weary Way Tavern where she vanishes into the crowd, but he eventually spots her in a booth. When Danas notices Imogen in the bar, though, she disappears again, and Imogen and Bertrand go back to the warehouse.\n\nThere, the outside team has decided to go inside, but Orym is unable to unlock either the front or back door for them in the darkness inside. Laudna manages to pick the front door lock and she and Dorian join Orym inside, joined a few minutes later by everyone else except Bertrand who offers to stay outside and caw like a raven if someone comes.\n\nThe inside group investigates the offices and finds letters and a ledger: evidence that Danas was covering up the ongoing pilferage from the warehouse stock. They decide to head back to the Weary Way and see if Danas is still there, \"disguising\" themselves with clothing from the warehouse. Their appearance outside startles Bertrand who raven-caws as their pre-arranged signal for the appearance of strangers.\n\nThe entire group arrives at the tavern. One of the musicians, for a silver, tells Dorian a gnomish woman matching Danas's appearance just went upstairs, and they all head there. They find hallways filled with closed doors, but FCG is able to sense the thoughts of those behind the doors and eventually they find a room filled with many presences along with Danas herself. Orym is able to hear her voice through the door, nervously explaining that people have been asking questions at the warehouse and she thinks they have been found out.\n\nA sinister voice responds, suggesting that it was because Danas couldn't keep her mouth shut or handle herself, putting him in danger himself. They will need to adjust their supply lines, and he will no longer require her services. There is a gasp and a gurgling sound, and Orym kicks the door frantically, joined by Ashton. They eventually manage to batter it down.\n\nSeeing no one, Ashton rushes in and smashes the wardrobe. From the splinters he sees movement and hears skittering throughout the chamber, and the creepy voice, from behind him, says: \"Oh, interesting. I wasn't expecting more visitors.\" It comes from a black-cloak-wrapped, sallow and pale dwarvish figure in the dark shadows of the corner.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nRoll initiative!\n\nDorian , Laudna , Fearne each run in and attack the dark figure, doing minimal damage. Orym succeeds in making him drop his rapier but he immediately picks it back up and counterattacks, wounding Orym severely. As the fight continues, the figure calls out, \"Children?\" They hear tiny feet and scraping claws as from underneath all the furniture seven small cloaked grey creatures, called shade creepers , emerge and attack. They are easily hit and have low hit points, but there are a lot of them each doing piercing and necrotic damage. Under their attack, Orym is knocked unconscious, but FCG immediately uses his last spell to cast Healing Word on him.\n\n![Snake-Fearne - ArtbyMikuTee](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/2c/Snake-Fearne_-_ArtbyMikuTee.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/285?cb=20211108022826)\n\nThe party for the most part concentrates on taking out the shade creepers, learning that as they die they explode in slightly damaging flames. Laudna succeeds in significantly wounding the dwarf with an Eldritch Blast and he becomes afraid of her thanks to her Form of Dread. Fearne wild shapes into a constrictor snake with hair and blindsight. Bertrand , freshly arrived from downstairs, manages to kill another of the shade creepers, but the dwarf casts Darkness around himself that no one (except Fearne's snake shape) can see within. Striking blindly and recklessly, Ashton nevertheless manages to hit him for significant damage but is seriously wounded as he retreats. Imogen takes a bad hit from one of the shade creepers which FCG halves, and Laudna takes a hit from another.\n\nThe party are almost all significantly wounded at this point. FCG hits one of the shade creepers with his grappling arm and dumps the damage he took from Imogen into it as well, killing it. Dorian heals Laudna a bit with Cure Wounds while the rest of the party kills all the shade creepers outside the zone of magical darkness hiding the dwarf. Bertrand runs into the darkness blindly, running into Dorian and wounding him, then backs out. Inside the darkness, Orym is hit again and brought within an inch of unconsciousness, but Dorian heals him and Fearne in snake form eats the last of the shade creepers.\n\nThe darkness remains, but there is no sign of the dwarf creature anywhere. Imogen finds Danas 's body under a table inside the darkness-- her throat has been slit. They also find a foot-wide hole in the wall under the desk. There is a knock at the door: two bouncers from downstairs investigating the noise. Imogen answers giggling, she and Dorian apologize for their exuberance and promise to keep it down, and the guards believe them and leave. The party  leaves via the window, dropping Danas's body out first, and they make their way to Lord Eshteross's estate where they are admitted.\n\nThey show him Danas's body, the ledger, and the papers they found in the warehouse office, describe the pale dwarf she was working for, and tell him about the brumestone residue. Lord Eshteross is impressed. He asks them how they feel about what has transpired, and when the response is that they wish they had been able to save Danas and still want to find the dwarf, he offers them a contract to be signed in the morning. As such, he will notify them of interesting work that comes in. Evelyn pays them and they celebrate with a carrot cake he has baked himself. He asks about the party's name, and tells them to think about it when they can't come up with one quickly.\n\nDorian asks about Lord Eshteross's past, and they learn he was once a mercenary. One of his employers was Mistress Prudaj , who taught him true values and showed him the existence of evil among both the power structure and the criminals of the city. When she died, she left him everything, and he is continuing her work.\n\nThe party heads out to the Spire by Fire tavern where they drink and talk a bit, agreeing to meet in the morning. Ashton and FCG head home. Bertrand buys the drinks and pays for rooms for the Tal'Dorei members of the party, and gradually everyone goes either home or to their rooms as Bertrand continues to celebrate with multiple drinks. Dorian stays with him to take care of him.\n\nWhen they reach home, Ashton goes to see Milo Krook and throws a bag of money in their face. Ashton asks Milo to find out everything possible about Lord Eshteross, mentioning, \"You know what happened last time.\" Milo asks if \"she\" has come around recently, and no, she hasn't. Ashton would like to cement this before anything weird happens.\n\nBack at the bar, Bertrand is becoming drunker and more loquacious as the evening progresses. Eventually, he decides to go for a walk and sends Dorian to bed.\n\nAsleep at home, Imogen dreams of walking through the green fields of her home village of Gelvaan . At the same time, Bertrand is wandering through the streets of the Core Spire and ducks into a side alley to relieve himself. He notices a shadowed figure standing there, which slowly approaches. Bertrand draws his rapier as the pale dwarf's voice tells him to move deeper into the alley. When he declines, in a flash of unnatural speed the dwarf moves, stabbing Bertrand twice. Bertrand lets out a \"Caw!\" and falls unconscious.\n\n![Bertrand in the alley - Monica Magana](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/2a/Bertrand_in_the_alley_-_Monica_Magana.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20211108020856)\n\nAs he does, Imogen's dream changes and she sees the horizon entirely consumed in a red swirling lightning storm that rapidly swallows her. She stands frozen until a female voice urges her to run. She sprints toward her home, darkened by the storm following her. As she reaches and opens the door, she turns and sees the figure of an older refined man standing where she had been, walking proudly into the tempest before he disappears.\n\nLying bleeding in the alley, Bertrand's vision blurs as a coldness and peace settles over him, and the dwarf wishes him a good night.\n\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e03-the_trail_and_the_toll"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E08-A Woodworker's Quandary","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, this group of heroes, upon forging themselves a space here in the city of Jrusar , you encountered some dangerous denizens, you made some allies, and you began to discuss about the possibility of this becoming a thing. Upon searching some of the various rumors that are swirling about, you heard that there were mysterious vanishings, people who have gone missing around the Dreamscape Theater . You went and got tickets for the show, enjoyed the performances, and began to ask around for information about these recent disappearances.\n\nAs you began to travel about, you pieced together some interesting details, met some curious characters, and eventually found yourselves ambushed in the back alley where these disappearances you discovered had been occurring, as a part of the wall seemed to attack you. You managed to defeat this strange, amorphous, nightmarish wall creature , and as it lay slain on the ground, the wardens , the Wilders, came to inspect. The brief interrogation to yourselves and being supported by the denizens of the Dreamscape theater as well, you were given a pass. As they continued to inspect the body of this corpse and hopefully close their investigation into these disappearances, of which they did not do the hard work, you began to walk away, where in the alleyway there was someone awaiting you, an older gnomish gentleman that seemed to have been keeping an eye and an ear open to your penchant for seeking out missing persons.\n\nUpon introducing themself, you met Chetney . At which point you said, \"Walk and talk. We're going to head to the Spire by Fire and we can figure out what the hell is going on.\"\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party talks with Chetney on the way to the Spire by Fire . He shares that he came to Jrusar two to four weeks ago to find a person named Gurge Kisgregg and has spent \"some decent time\" with him. Yesterday morning, he was to meet him at Gurge's home, but Gurge wasn't there and the home was a mess. Since he knew that Gurge enjoyed theater, Chetney had gone to the Dreamscape looking for Gurge when he noticed the party.\n\nOnce at the tavern, the party introduce themselves. Chetney is from Uthodurn in Wildemount . Gurge was very helpful in helping Chetney understand \"some things\" and was going to introduce him to people that might employ him, outside of Marquet . Chetney suggests it's possible that his friend might have been arrested. Since the party is still very beat up from their fight against the wall, they propose to sleep at the Spire by Fire and in the morning, they will all head over to Gurge's hovel on the outskirts of the Smolder Spire and see what they can uncover. They agree to be paid in Chetney's woodcrafted toys.\n\nAs they are winding down for the evening, Orym notices that the mysterious cloaked Hubatt Corsair from the theater [1] has followed them to the Spire by Fire, and is surreptitiously watching them. Orym motions for him to come over, but the figure instead abruptly leaves. Orym and Chetney trail him and eventually persuade him to stop in a deserted alley. He tells them he wants to talk with Dorian , and Orym goes back and brings the rest of the party there.\n\nThe figure reveals its face: it is Cyrus Wyvernwind , Dorian's older brother. He just wants to see how Dorian's doing. When Dorian left home, at first Cyrus was angry, but he learned that it is in the nature of their air genasi people to wander, and eventually he felt the pull of wanderlust himself. To earn a living, he became a sellsword but there is now a 20,000 gp bounty on his head. He had been hired by the Gold Guild of Treshi to escort a caravan through the outer trails, but the other hired guards had apparently plotted together to steal from it. While robbing it, they woke a large stone golem being transported in a cart marked with the initials \" J.H. \", and took the golem with them when they escaped. Cyrus became the fall guy. The Corsairs have been helping him to stay safe from the bounty hunters seeking him.\n\n![FCG being a flask - BlackSalander](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f3/FCG_being_a_flask_-_BlackSalander.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20211220204734)\n\nCyrus doesn't want to go home until this situation is resolved. He and Dorian are the only children of the noble leadership of the Silken Squall - the best analogous title is probably \"prince\". Dorian's real name is Brontë Wyvernwind. The Silken Squall is a nomadic city of floating tents that travels the world, but has been in Marquet for quite a long time. As of seven months ago, it was in Aeshanadoor in the south.\n\nTelepathically, Imogen tells Ashton that she noticed the letter that was dropped in their room at Krook House [2] bore the initials \"J.H.\", the same as were on the caravan Cyrus was hired to guard. Ashton asks her to give it a day and if nothing turns up, it will be time to have that conversation.\n\nDorian escorts Cyrus back to the Lantern Spire and Elder's Post, the safe house of the Corsairs. On the way, Dorian gives him the sending stone and tells him to use it if he needs anything.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nIn the morning, while eating breakfast and discussing plans, the party notices a posted flier complaining of a recent rise in violence and dangerous lawlessness by the Hubatt Corsairs , and calling on the Chandei Quorum to take steps to combat this by using Paragon's Call , a well-known profit-oriented mercenary company from the Hellcatch Valley . After discussing this, the party decides that Paragon's Call would be more likely to work for the rich of the city against the interests of the common folk.\n\nThey head to the Smolder Spire and Gurge's hovel. Chetney quickly picks the lock, and inside they find definite signs of a struggle, including smatterings of blood, but no sign of a hole similar to those used by the shade creepers and Dugger . [3] Laudna is able to determine there are claw marks in the furniture, too large for the shade creepers they've encountered previously.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen also finds a few traces of claw marks and a bit of blood that has been attempted to be cleaned up in the street outside. There, she is confronted by Siroc , Gurge's landlady. Gurge has not paid his rent, and she is unhappy, complaining about a very recent dire wolf attack down the street, burglaries, a magical detonation at the Core Spire , and spirits haunting the Prakash Pyre . The party suspects the damage to the hovel may have been caused by a dire wolf.\n\nWhen she leaves, the group takes stock, asking Chetney for any other information he has. The hovel was just a short-term rental, not Gurge's actual home. Gurge was rumored to be sort of a wild man, living out in the jungles, and Chetney was told to meet him at the hovel by the people who sent Chetney to Jrusar, the master craftsman's guild in the Savalirwood . Chetney was kicked out of his old job when they moved away from working with wood.\n\n![Rat-Fearne - Kageyama Satsuki](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/8f/Rat-Fearne_-_Kageyama_Satsuki.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/275?cb=20211220194307)\n\nThe party heads down toward the factory where the dire wolf attack took place, asking the wardens posted there about it and telling them they're looking for their friend, Gurge. One of them immediately goes inside to check with the boss. FCG casts Detect Thoughts on the remaining guard and learns that he is suspicious of how they would know Gurge, and that he too wants to report this. When he also goes inside the factory, Fearne wildshapes into a rat and follows. She sees the guard locking the interior gate to the factory behind him, and follows him to a room where he and the other warden they spoke to are reporting to their superior .\n\nThe wardens have been told not to engage in any speculation about Gurge, so when the party came questioning them about him, they grew suspicious. The superior tells them to tell the party that Gurge has been arrested and held in the Granite Hold and is none of their concern. He'll take care of the rest. As the guards turn to leave, one of them steps on rat-Fearne, bringing her to zero hit points and causing her to revert to her faun form in front of all three wardens.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e08-a_woodworker's_quandary"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E01-The Draw of Destiny","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nI would like to welcome you to Marquet . The year is 843 PD, or Post Divergence. A landmass once marred by a vengeful god during The Calamity , the staggeringly twisted mountain ranges created in its wake divided the regions that have now developed into a varied and beautiful continent. The epicenter of this ancient destruction created the Rumedam Desert , a vast expanse of sand dunes and rocky landmarks that encompasses nearly a third of Marquet, dotted with oasis townships surrounding the central city of Ank'Harel , known as the Jewel of Hope. Here, the long-living ruler J'mon Sa Ord and their Hands of Ord keep the peace and prosperity of their people protected.\n\nBeyond the Rumedam Desert and its sister desert, the Panagrip Sands to the south, lies the Gloomed Jungles of Aeshanadoor , a shaded territory of treacherous wilderness and careful guard by the historically orcish erudite society of Yios . Here, many skilled dreamers seek the Marquesian peak of collegiate study and social influence within the political powerhouse of its ruling council, the Court of the Lambent Path .\n\nTo the southwest, a towering range of mountain spires climb into the clouds, known as the Taloned Highlands , where massive shelves and plateaus scattered among the peaks are home to elevated valleys abundant with agriculture and rural life, before reaching to the apex where the military might of the region is held by the Stratos Throne .\n\nNear the center of this continent, the rugged badlands known as the Hellcatch Valley acts as the roadway nexus between the cage-like mountain ranges of Marquet, where numerous independent villages and cities survive among the harsh, dusty canyons, and compete for dominance.\n\nThe history of Marquet is filled with vibrant culture, incredible discoveries, political intrigue, and inter-region warfare that recently culminated two decades back in a years-long conflict known as the Apex War between the Stratos Throne and the Court of the Lambent Path, that left both sides exhausted, expended, and without victory. This truce has continued to this day, as both factions continue the slow work to rebuild their societies to their former glory.\n\n![Jrusar - Clara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/ba/Jrusar_-_Clara.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20211022063902)\n\nOur story, however, begins to the northwest of the Hellcatch Valley, within the natural boundaries of the Serpentwind Peaks , where the lush jungle valley of the Oderan Wilds thrums with life and mystery. Here among the vines and mists that choke the uncarved paths of the rainforest, howling beasts and long-dormant shadows are rumored to hide among the lost relics of ancient days. Here, the dense jungle canopy is home to numerous towns along the Honored Trails , where travelers and traders trudge through the dangerous wilds to seek their fortunes. Here, from the central jungle floor, rises five tower-like mountains that reach for the heavens, where upon their rocky exterior, numerous streets and urban districts have been carved into them to form a singular city connected by bridge and cable. These spires glow with the thousands of lights and lanterns that mark the Oderan Wilds' capital city of Jrusar , home to the Chandei Quorum that oversees and controls the larger populace of the region. The spiraling streets bustle with life and chatter beneath the cloud-dappled blue sky, where the innumerable birds fly among the Simurgh Riders that keep watch.\n\nHere, in Jrusar, is where our story begins.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Laudna and Imogen - Zoe Roellin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d8/Laudna_and_Imogen_-_Zoe_Roellin.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20211027230351)\n\nAboard one of the cable cars connecting the five spires of Jrusar , climbing toward the Aerie Spire, are Imogen and Laudna . They have been in the city for two weeks, since Imogen went to both the Ascension's Rise University and the Starpoint Conservatory seeking to use their extensive libraries for her research. She was told they were reserved for students and others with approval, but she could submit a formal request at the Conservatory. After two weeks, she has come to ask about the request's status, but on arrival she is handed a letter denying it unless she gets approval from either the Guro Coterie or the Chandei Quorum , or enrolls. Disappointed and discouraged, they take the gondola back down to the bustling main thoroughfare of the Core Spire.\n\n![Chewing abilities](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nMeanwhile, a slightly hungover Ashton wakes up in their room in the Krook House , in the Fownsee Hollow in the interior of the Core Spire, greeted happily by Fresh Cut Grass . After breakfast, they make their way out of the Hollow into the main thoroughfare of the Core Spire and decide to head to the Spire by Fire Inn to seek badly-needed paying work. FCG impresses Ishir , the Inn's owner, with his ability to chew coins and is offered a job performing this talent for the customers.\n\n![Arrival at Jrusar - Cersonality](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nMeanwhile, Orym , Fearne , and Dorian arrive in the Aerie Spire of the city via skyship . Orym has been given a task to find a man by Keyleth , the leader of the Air Ashari , and told to bring his two friends to assist him. The group takes a gondola along with one other passenger, a pachydan wearing an ornate earring. When they reach their destination, Fearne manages to steal his earring before he hurries off, to Dorian and Orym's serious consternation. The group heads toward the Core Spire and the Spire by Fire Inn.\n\nAs sunset arrives, Laudna and Imogen make their way toward their home at the Viduun-Devaar, the Windowed Wall. As they travel, they hear a low, bassy rumble and see a dull blue flash emerging 30-40 feet ahead of them from a cart. A small arcane sphere emerges from it, spooking the sillgoats pulling it and causing it to overturn and spill furniture and household goods into the street. As they watch, a kitchen knife, a table, a broom, a sword, and a rug begin to stir and come to life, attacking the passersby. Ashton and FCG hear the commotion inside the Spire by Fire, and come out to investigate, just as Fearne, Dorian, and Orym arrive on the scene as well. Roll initiative!\n\n![The Furniture Battle - Amaury Allaire](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nDorian and Orym attack and damage the sword, while Fearne and Imogen go for the rug. FCG buffs Ashton and begins attaching his sawblade arm. Laudna transforms into a Form of Dread and casts Bane on the carpet and the sword. The carpet grapples Fearne, and the table slams into Orym for serious damage. Ashton destroys the broom, but also takes damage from the various hostile objects.\n\nAs they fight, another figure charges out of the Inn: an elderly gentleman with beautiful silver facial hair and a nice ponytail holding back his receding hair. Shouting out, \"Yes, for the good of Jrusar! I will enter the fray with you!\" he joins the fight.\n\n![Imogen - Laurene Desoutter](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nDorian manages to pull the rug off Fearne, who casts Burning Hands on it. Orym destroys the sword, and Imogen destroys the knife with a Witch Bolt . The rug grapples Dorian, but Laudna almost immediately kills it with Eldritch Blast . This leaves only the table which Bertrand damages twice, but it retaliates wounding him seriously. However, FCG transfers half the damage to himself. Ashton then destroys the table, ending the battle.\n\nThe elderly gentleman asks if they all know each other, and when they explain, commends them for how well they worked together and asks them if they are looking for similar work. Ashton asks if there's money involved, and Laudna and Imogen want to know if there might be clout involved; in other words, if it might get the favorable attention of the Chandei Quorum. The gentleman assures them there could be plenty of clout and money involved and introduces himself: Sir Bertrand Bell . He knows someone that might pay well for services they could render - have they heard of Lord Ariks Eshteross ? He offers to buy them all a drink and they can discuss it.\n\nWhile they are chatting, Fearne accepts Ashton's offer to let her look inside the glass plug in his head for a gold piece. When she does, he deftly pickpockets the earring that she had stolen from the pachydan before the group all goes inside the Spire by Fire.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Spire by Fire - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nBertrand has been living in the city for a while off and on. He asks if any of them are being hunted by the law for anything, and they either don't respond or evade the issue. He acts as a talent locator and is always looking for finder's fees, and thinks that Lord Eshteross and his lady might be interested in meeting with them. Lord Eshteross protects the good people of Jrusar from its shadier characters.\n\nThey each introduce themselves. FCG shares that his former group was killed near a silver mine while he was in stasis, and he was found there by Ashton . Ashton has lived in Jrusar for a long time now, picking up odd jobs and living in the Core. Laudna was originally from Whitestone , but that was a long time ago.\n\nThey decide to see Lord Eshteross in the morning, and Bertrand puts up the visitors at the Inn while Laudna and Imogen head home where they are greeted by their landlady, Zhudanna . She tells them what she knows about Lord Eshteross: he is one of the odd recluses of the city who a long time ago worked for Mistress Prudaj , the former owner of his manor. When she died twenty years ago, he took over.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Inn, Orym knocks at Bertrand's door, waking him. Orym asks if Bertrand knows anyone named either Oshad Breshio or \"The Anger\", but neither rings a bell. He then goes to talk to Fearne and Dorian and confirms they're on board with going to go see Lord Eshteross in the morning. Fearne and Dorian then go back downstairs for a nightcap.\n\nDownstairs, Ashton joins the ongoing card game between Kalliyan and a half-giant, but loses badly. FCG confirms with him that they're both on board with joining the rest of the group in the morning. Dorian tries playing his lyre for the drinking crowd and fails miserably, but does a little better on the flute. Fearne tries to help Ashton's gambling by seeing his opponents' cards, aided by FCG casting Detect Thoughts , but they fail to communicate their knowledge to him and he loses again. Fearne does, however, notice Ashton's purloined earring. When the others have gone to bed, FCG finds the drunkest person in the bar and puts him to bed in his own room.\n\nIn the morning, the party assembles downstairs and makes their way to Lord Eshteross's manor. Bertrand warns them to stand up straight and follow his lead. He knocks, and is admitted after the caretaker checks with Lord Eshteross. They are escorted to a room holding a tall leather chair facing away from them. Lord Eshteross's voice greets Bertrand, asking why he has returned, and Bertrand nervously tells him he has brought a talented group that might assist him in his endeavors. They have come to prove themselves.\n\nLord Eshteross stands, saying, \"Then show me.\" He tosses his cane in the air, catches it, and rushes toward them.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e01-the_draw_of_destiny"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E02-Trial by Firelight","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nOn the continent of Marquet , disparate destinies begin to intertwine as a few small groups of companions whose lives have folded together all begin to converge within the center of the Oderan Wilds , amongst the various spires of the central city of Jrusar . Upon wandering your ways through the city streets, suddenly there was a commotion. It looked like a cart-- something had detonated and sent it onto its side, and let loose a cadre of enchanted utensils and furniture. Jumping to the defense of the locals, this ragtag unexpected group of allies managed to throw them to the ground and keep everyone safe, as well as catching the eye of the esteemed -- once esteemed -- fighter, Sir Bertrand Bell . Bertrand then offered to pay for a meal for this crew, assemble them, invite them if they are looking for work and opportunity to a patron that he has a relationship with.\n\nAfter some discussion and a night's rest, you all gathered the next morning and followed him to the estate of Lord Eshteross . Upon being led into the somewhat dusty and dark interior, led by a woman named Evelyn , to a study, you stepped within and were met with a roaring fireplace and a darkly lit, dark wood interior. The individual sitting in a chair facing away from you, Lord Eshteross himself, a well-to-do older orcish gentleman, began to enquire as to what Bertrand's reason was for coming to his estate. And upon pitching yourselves as possible allies, hires, if you will, Lord Eshteross stood from his chair, turned to you all, and said essentially, \"Show me.\" Then, clutching his cane , rushed you.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nRoll initiative!\n\nUp first, Orym tells Lord Eshteross , \"We really don't have to do this,\" and holds his action, but Laudna has no such reservations and immediately casts Hex and Eldritch Blast on him. The others also attack, landing with both spells and physical attacks, with the exception of Bertrand who retreats across the room and watches, making occasional encouraging comments.\n\n![Lord Eshteross Fight - Lap Pun Cheung](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/bb/Lord_Eshteross_Fight_-_Lap_Pun_Cheung.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20211030172740)\n\nThe party does well at first, landing some significant damage while not taking much in return. However, Lord Eshteross uses his three attacks and an Action Surge to good effect to severely wound Orym, damage Laudna, and knock Dorian unconscious to join Orym prone at Eshteross's feet. The party continues to hit Eshteross, while FCG brings Dorian back to consciousness, and Dorian immediately gives Orym badly-needed healing as well.\n\n“\nThese are challenging times in the Wilds. Terrible things happen to good people, and much of the Quorum promises protection or justice, but meets expectations with excuses. The Ivory Syndicate moves nearly unimpeded through Jrusar and the great Honored Trails of the jungle, further tightening their grip on the fine people of this region. And this is just the social struggles. Rumors of darker, deadlier things hide on the outskirts of these whispered streets, dangers both ancient and new creep up in the jungles surrounding, even the further townships where protection is a luxury. So what do I have to offer? Well, employment, for those who want to do something about it. I'm not interested in common sellswords.\n”\n\n– \nLord Eshteross explaining his mission.[1]\n[!h]\n\n\n\n\nLord Eshteross, significantly wounded at this point, says, \"Enough!\" and moves back to his chair. He admits he is surprised; they indeed do have some skill. As most of the group gathers around, he adjusts the top of his cane and those closest feel a warmth which Dorian only much later realizes was a Zone of Truth . He asks about their goals, saying that these are challenging times and that while the Chandei Quorum promises justice and protection, they have failed. The Ivory Syndicate moves unimpeded through both Jrusar and the Honored Trails of the jungle, and there are rumors of yet darker dangers creeping closer. He offers them a chance to combat these evils in return for payment and a chance to prove the unity of their ideals, but stresses that for both their safety, they cannot reveal for whom they work.\n\nOrym is sold, but FCG suggests they discuss it among themselves first. The party leaves for a tavern where they talk a little about their individual goals and histories, still hiding more than they reveal. Laudna shows them her dead rat with a raven skull that she made herself, named Pâté de Rolo , which she puppets and speaks through. Orym recognizes the de Rolo name, and the party learns that Laudna left Whitestone after the Briarwoods took over but before Vox Machina arrived and restored the de Rolos to their rulership of the city. Bertrand proudly shows them his Vox Machina lapel pin. FCG urges everyone to be open and honest with each other, and Pâté, Orym, and Ashton agree.\n\n![Laudna with Pate - LornArt](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/31/Laudna_with_Pate_-_LornArt.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20211103001050)\n\nThey return to Lord Eshteross and tell him they've decided to accept his offer, but want a written contract. Lord Eshteross replies they will do that if this preliminary venture goes well. The Dayal Hall is a privately funded learning center in the Core Spire, and Lord Eshteross has been overseeing its deliveries and supplies storage. Recently, however, there have been thefts. He would like them to go to his storage warehouse in the Lantern Spire , called \"Prudaj Textiles\", and investigate. They will each receive a 50 gold advance, 150 gold for a \"satisfactory conclusion\", and 350 gold if the source of the thefts is dealt with. They must not let the warehouse workers know that they work for Lord Eshteross.\n\nOn the way out, Fearne tries and fails to steal a \"shiny\", then tries and fails to lie her way out of it, but Lord Eshteross lets it go. Making their way to the Lantern Spire, they locate Prudaj Textiles, a storage facility. Laudna and Dorian head around its side, Fearne and Ashton guard the front, and Imogen, Orym, and FCG go inside just as several dead rodents are flung out the front door. They are greeted by a worker asking if he can help them. Imogen convincingly tells him they're here on behalf of Madam Zhudanna , who is opening a shop in the Core Spire.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nAs Imogen , Orym , and FCG wander the warehouse, uncertain what they're looking for, Orym notices three crates that look more recently arrived than the others. He manages to get atop one and opens it, noticing that it had been previously forced open. Inside are simple fabrics and clothing, and some small bags of dried figs and grains. There is also a gap as if something small has been removed, and a strange gravel-like residue left behind. Both FCG and Imogen attempt to read the thoughts of the workers, but neither learns anything useful. When FCG opens another crate that looks recently opened, he too notices a gap and a granular residue. He uses a lens over his ocular sensor to Identify the residue: it is brumestone , a very rare substance now used to keep skyships aloft.\n\n![Using the winged boots - ellejohara](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/2d/Using_the_winged_boots_-_ellejohara.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20211103021806)\n\nMeanwhile, outside, Laudna , Ashton , and Dorian discover a second entry to the warehouse from the rear alley, sealed and barred. There is a rotted rope ladder hanging from the roof fifteen feet above them, and Dorian uses his Winged Boots to reach it, carrying Laudna, but all they find is a thoroughly ruined leather satchel holding a moldy leather case, which she takes.\n\nMeanwhile, also outside, Fearne asks Bertrand about his family (no significant other, no children that he knows of), and when he asks, tells him she does want to settle down with a family someday. He also shares that the Ivory Syndicate mentioned by Lord Eshteross is dangerous and clandestine. Bertrand is concerned that they may be involved in their current investigation and since they're aware of his existence, might recognize him if he enters the warehouse. Fearne, however, really wants to go in and is easily talked into it by Bertrand.\n\nShe arrives just as FCG is attempting to let Imogen know about the brumestone, and makes a total hash of trying to talk her way in. An increasingly suspicious and frazzled Danas , the manager, is arguing with her when Orym takes a pratfall as a distraction. FCG reads Danas's thoughts, which are to get them out as quickly as possible, and they decide to leave.\n\nOutside, the group rejoins in the back alley to discuss what they found. Imogen suspects the thefts are an inside job, and they decide it might be smart to stake the place out once darkness falls. They decide on one group at the back door, one at the front, and one person inside in case anything arrives other than by way of the doors. Ashton, Laudna, FCG, and Fearne are Team Back Door; Dorian, Bertrand, and Imogen are Team Full Frontal; and Orym is designated to be made invisible by Dorian and sneak inside while the employees are leaving. While they wait, Laudna investigates the pockets of a drunk that passes out near them, but Ashton talks her out of keeping the three coppers she finds.\n\nTeam Full Frontal waits by the front door as two of the employees leave, then Dorian casts Invisibility on Orym and he succeeds in darting through the door as the third leaves, leaving only Danas inside nervously scurrying between the crates before she leaves as well. Team Full Frontal watches her tensely pull a note from her pocket and read it before briskly running off. Bertrand and Imogen follow her, leaving Dorian alone at the front door.\n\n![Orym in the warehouse - lida Onni](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOrym is alone inside the warehouse in total darkness. He sits down and starts listening intently. Laudna Messages Imogen, who tells her they're following Danas, Orym is inside, and Dorian's alone. FCG attempts to contact Orym, but all he gets is a feeling of FCG's curiosity. Laudna then contacts him and he confirms he's okay, but he doesn't know Imogen and Bertrand have left. Worried about him, Fearne bangs on the metallic door. They consider sending some of their group to the front, or loosening some of the bars on the back door, but decide to leave him alone to do his thing.\n\nOrym sits in the darkness inside, blade drawn, facing the metallic banging he just heard. Team Back Door remains in place outside. Dorian is pacing nervously at the front door, and Bertrand and Imogen are chasing Danas through the streets of Jrusar.

Imogen and Fearne try to assure her they were trying to contact them the whole time, but Ashton and Orym both agree that a lot of bad stuff happened to them and they need two things: to relax a little, and to figure out what they're going to do next.

FCG is deeply concerned Ashton's acting potentially suicidal, but Ashton assures him they've learned a lot in the past few days and thought about their life and their past.

Laudna tells Imogen she is her anchor, and when they were separated, she did terrible things, but Imogen assures her that she's not a bad person. They are each other's anchors. Laudna explains the killing of Bor'Dor and confesses his betrayal broke her. She lost control, and she thinks Delilah Briarwood is back. But part of her thinks this isn't wholly a bad thing; that they can use her power in the coming battle. Imogen understands. She feels the same about the power of Ruidus .\n\nAt the core of the marketplace, they hear people gathering, and they hear the familiar voice of Ludinus Da'leth telling the crowd that they were never meant to be bound by the gods' laws but to rise above them. Floating above the fountain is his illusory image giving a speech very similar to the one he gave at the Malleus Key. Two guards run up, and immediately find and destroy the small crystal globe producing the image. Apparently this has been happening regularly. Laudna and Imogen then buy a new dress for Laudna. Imogen gives her the Weavepiercer Gloves , and Laudna crafts Pâté's house into a backpack using her leather belts, given to her by Delilah to make her look more like Vex'ahlia on the Sun Tree .\n\nMeanwhile, Chetney, Fearne, and Orym head to Dayal Hall and speak to Ajit Dayal , who tells them massive numbers of international soldiers are passing through Jrusar on their way to the Hellcatch Valley . A day ago, J'mon Sa Ord , the leader of Ank'Harel , was in town meeting with the Chandei Quorum and there have been discussions about involving the Stratos Throne as well. The loss of magic, however, has caused some prisoners who were magically held to be able to escape, including Levtonia , the leader of the Ivory Syndicate . They ask him about old magic and he brings out Daramon , an older teacher. Chetney shows him Ludinus' harness but he has no idea what it is. During their conversation, they gather that those who heard Ludinus' voice during the Apogee Solstice were those who were near a ley line nexus. Ajit warns them that some Mahaan houses have hired some Hubatt Corsairs during the crisis, so they should avoid fighting them.\n\nThey decide to go to the Temple of the Duskmaven just to see what's happening there, but on the way Chetney catches a delectable scent and runs after it. To the others, it isn't a pleasant smell, but they follow Chetney as he runs, seeing a cloaked figure holding a pouch out to him. The man throws the pouch and Chetney lunges for it. His transformation begins, but as he bites into it dried herbs fill his mouth and the figure throws a silver chain net over him, burning into his skin.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Fearne in battle - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/a/a7/Fearne_in_battle_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230717011751)\n\nAs Fearne and Orym catch up to the netted Chetney , his dwarven captor tells them to stay away, it's just business, but an unimpressed Fearne immediately casts Blight on him. Chetney's transformation was interrupted by the silver net but he uses his Blood Curse of Bloated Agony on the dwarf, while Orym attacks with his sword. The dwarf tells them that Chetney's a problematic beast and there's money on his head, shoves Orym and knocks him prone, then drags Chetney further into the alley. Fearne begs to be allowed to kiss Chetney before he's taken away, and uses the opportunity to cast Stoneskin on him, while Orym tries to slash away the net. As the dwarf continues dragging Chetney away he casts Charm Person on Orym, who stops fighting him, and the dwarf says, \" Tuyen sends her regards.\" Fearne bamfs out Little Mister and uses Fiery Teleportation to move Chetney out from under the net and 15 feet away, and the thwarted dwarf Misty Steps away, threatening that he'll see them again. An embarrassed Chetney admits that the dwarf was sent by the shopkeeper of the Prism Emporium that he attacked in wolf form for overcharging him, months ago.\n\nChetney goes invisible, and the group continues on to the Smolder Spire and the Temple of the Duskmaven there. One of the priests tells them that many in the city are feeling the same fear and confusion that they say they are, but that if the gods can see this through, they will see mortals through it with them. The priest still feels the Duskmaven's presence and is comforted by it, although the temple is in a period of mourning and preparation. She invites Fearne, Orym, and the invisible Chetney to drink of the waters with her, and leads them to an endless waterfall where all three drink. After a moment, Chetney looks down, and discovers he is now visible and the three of them are alone in the temple.\n\n![The screams of the Champion by Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1c/The_screams_of_the_Champion_by_Cha_Cha_Rae.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230719210024)\n\nThey move to the doors, but as Orym touches them they fly open to reveal a deep red sky over the Tishtan excavation site , the activated Malleus Key firing its red beam upward. In the middle of the beam is a black orb, and they hear a continuous screaming. The doors slam shut and all they see is a massive white mask. They come out of their collective trance still kneeling by the water. The priest states again, \"We're in a period of mourning. For one of our own .\" Chetney asks how they can help turn the tide, and the answer is simply, \"Faith.\"\n\n![Laudna by Edu Benavente](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe three make their way back to rejoin the rest of Bells Hells and swap stories of their various adventures. They reach the conclusion they need to talk to Keyleth about the man whom they saw compressed into the now-screaming orb. They speculate they need to learn more about the gods and find their own faiths, and FCG tries to convince them they could all worship the Changebringer . Ashton and Laudna aren't yet convinced that saving the gods is in the best interests of mortals, and Ashton grows increasingly angry, saying he won't pick a god; they can pick him. Laudna suggests you can have faith in things other than the gods, like other people or the spirits of the earth. Can the party accomplish their goals if they all have different beliefs? Orym points out that there is one main problem. They can feel different ways about it, but they still have to solve it.\n\nThey decide to spend their Scrys before bed. Fearne's attempt on Ludinus fails, but FCG sees Imogen 's mother Liliana Temult walking in a red dust storm side-by-side with Ludinus Da'leth , now marked with a withered and blackened hand. In the distance through the storm, FCG sees buildings, and in the sky above, the bluish green globe of Exandria . They are on Ruidus . The others try to convince FCG this proves Exandria is round, but he remains unconvinced, and the Changebringer's assurance (through a coin flip) that it is \"round\" does nothing to change his opinion. The party speculates that they will eventually need to \"ride the beam\" up to the moon to confront Ludinus.\n\nIn the morning, Imogen's staff hasn't regained enough charges to Teleport . FCG casts Identify on Ludinus' leather harness, learning that it is designed to funnel the essence of some sort of magic into the base of the wearer's neck, but it is no longer functional. They speculate that this reveals a weak spot on Ludinus, and that the harness might be repairable. Ashton suggests Ira Wendagoth .\n\nAshton picks up his enhanced glass hammer, incorporating the crystals from Hevestro 's cavern, and now bearing a switch. Ashton admits he's not sure what it will do, but it's beautiful.\n\nThat evening, Orym tries again to use the sending stone to contact Caleb Widogast , but is unsuccessful. Imogen tries Sending to Ira Wendagoth , also without success, and FCG fails Scrying on him. However, Fearne's Scry is successful, and she finds Ira trudging alone in a red dust storm. He reaches what looks like a huge red boulder, runs his fingers along it, then ducks into an opened alcove out of the wind. Once inside, a muscular humanoid with deep red oddly-textured skin, a non-ethereal reilora , approaches him and they appear to communicate telepathically.\n\nIn the morning, several of the skyships in port have departed. Imogen uses Orym's Sentinel Shield as her Teleportation focus and successfully transports the party to Zephrah , where it is a beautiful midday under the blossoming cherry tree just outside the village.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e65-a_path_of_vengeance"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E66-Aid of the Tempest","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells reunited in the aftermath of the Apogee Solstice . The red moon Ruidus remains hung in the air still, locked in orbit with the rest of Exandria . In searching for the location of some of your chased antagonists, you discovered some of them may not be on Exandria anymore. However, sending some of your new allies off to their own ventures, circling your wagons a bit and discussing what you found, there are some interesting hanging threads to be pursued. There are some artifacts from Ludinus ' past that have some intriguing possibility should their purpose and reason be discovered. There are some scattered elements of previous allies, some known, some not, and the discovery that Keyleth remains extremely, seemingly irrevocably wounded from the encounter in Marquet when all of this went down. As you prepped yourselves in Jrusar , you decided to pay her a visit, and in doing so, transported yourselves via the scepter that is carried by Imogen to Zephrah , the city of the Air Ashari in Tal'Dorei .\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nBells Hells arrives on a windswept cliffside overlooking the beautiful Air Ashari village of Zephrah . Orym is happy and excited to be home. Suddenly, a massive gust of wind slams into the party, knocking over Laudna , Chetney , and Imogen and pushing them toward the cliff edge. Two shadows swoop in on skysails accompanied by three more guards, but Orym calls out to them and is immediately recognized. His sister-in-law Maeve rushes up and Orym joyfully hugs her, then introduces the group. Maeve apologizes for knocking them down with her Gust of Wind , and tells them the Voice of the Tempest is resting after the Battle of the Red Center , during which some of the Ashari fighting there were teleported elsewhere. Most, though not all, have now been retrieved, and many of the Ashari were wounded and are recovering.\n\n![Orym with Keyleth - Matthew Johnson](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/91/Orym_with_Keyleth_-_Matthew_Johnson.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20230726023821)\n\nMaeve escorts them through the beautiful village to the central building where the Voice of the Tempest resides. There they meet another of Orym's sisters-in-law, Leeta , the Master of Defenses. She guides them to the art-filled bedroom where Keyleth rests in a large four-poster bed, still horribly wounded with red gashes that, though not bloody, look as fresh as when they were made. Otohan Thull 's anti-resurrection toxin also prevents healing, it seems, but they have found a potential remedy: an ointment made from the Blue Perennem flower. Keyleth has sent a group of Ashari including Orym's sister-in-law Baernie to get more of these flowers from the Grey Valley , but they have not returned for three days.\n\n![Keyleth's anger by Jenny Dolfen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/ed/Keyleth%27s_anger_by_Jenny_Dolfen.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230722204901)\n\nIn addition to Keyleth herself, there are three other wounded waiting, and the village lost a little more than two dozen of their people in the battle. The last thing Keyleth saw at the Malleus Key was \"someone important to me, someone I lost long ago,\" and she has sworn vengeance again Otohan, Ludinus, and Liliana . Imogen hesitantly suggests that perhaps Liliana caused the explosion of white light that sent so many far away from the battle and saved many lives, and Orym shares with Keyleth that Imogen is related to Liliana. Keyleth accepts this, but warns against any signs of betrayal. She wants to be well enough to travel to the Birth Heart of Vasselheim and speak to the great hierophants there, and she asks Orym and the party to look into what has happened to the first group sent to collect the blue perennem flowers. Orym accepts, admitting he is angrier than he has ever been, and Keyleth responds that she's been angry for thirty years. Sometimes anger is exactly what you need.\n\n![Leeta, Maeve and Orym by Jenny Dolfen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1d/Leeta%2C_Maeve_and_Orym_by_Jenny_Dolfen.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230726122721)\n\nLeeta leads them out. She confirms she was present with the other Ashari warriors during the activation of the Malleus Key by Ludinus Da'leth at the Apogee Solstice , about halfway up the crater wall, and tells them that the airship they dropped killed about 30 of the enemy and damaged the Key itself. The white explosion transported some, but not all of those present, and she was one of the ones who remained to help get Keyleth to safety and back to Zephrah.\n\nWhen they ask about the Grey Valley, Leeta gets Thollo , who fills them in on its cursed history as a demonic battlefield and the lingering influence of the Abyss there. When Ashton learns Thollo is a loremaster and historian of sorts, he shows him the Hishari helmet he stole months ago from the Twilight Mirror Museum , and Thollo confirms the facts Ashton had already uncovered about the Hishari group.\n\n![Alma and Orym by Jenny Dolfen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOrym wants to visit his mother, so he leads the group to a small, charming cottage and introduces them to Alma , who greets everyone happily and makes them carrot bran muffins. With recent events, she's worried about Orym's safety (urging him not to be a hero if he doesn't have to be), and he tries to reassure her. She shares a little about his childhood with the party and shows them his old clothes and toys. Chetney presents her with a small statue of Orym lunging with his sword and shield, carved with C-POP on the side, and they discover many of his old wooden toys were also created by C-POP Industries. This leads FCG and Imogen to wonder if Chetney and Alma have a past acquaintance.\n\nThey head to the shop of Torth the local weapon and armor-crafter, where Orym orders new leather armor to provide more coverage on his arms and legs. Ashton is referred to Fanny Z for new clothing, and he orders clothing reflecting his new goal of trying to help people, giving her some samples he stole from someone he says has better taste than he does. She suggests an \"antihero chic\" look, and they settle on \"legendary hero but make it fashion.\" It should be ready in a few days. Meanwhile, Laudna is flying Pâté in the wind off one of the cliffs.\n\nDone with shopping, they find Maeve at the tree near where they arrived, along with Keyleth's advisors and many of the Tempest Blades , gathered to see them off. Maeve gives Orym an empty backpack, telling him it needs to be filled with the perennem flowers. She also gives them three powerful healing potions and a sample flower to help their search. Leeta tells Orym, \"He'd be very proud of you,\" and Orym hugs both his sisters. He salutes the gathered Tempest Blades, who return the salute. Maeve casts her spell opening the tree trunk, and through the gap they see a monochrome valley. They all dash through.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![The Grey Valley - Ana Paula Alvarez](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe party emerges in the center of the Grey Valley , surrounded by a colorless and petrified forest. They see no blue anywhere, so Fresh Cut Grass flips their Coin of the Changebringer to seek advice through Divination on the direction the Blue Perennem flowers might lie in, and the answer is \"west\". Chetney is able to determine there is a faint smell of burned fat around them, and it comes from extraplanar fiendish creatures. Laudna warns Pâté they may be encountering some of his relatives and sends him invisibly west to look for blue flowers and fiends. Using Ashton 's Pass Without Trace , they move stealthily through the forest.\n\nEventually, they notice bits of tarnished metal and find a dome-shaped one that Chetney digs up, discovering the remains of a once-helmeted soldier. He keeps the damaged helmet. FCG casts Death Ward on Orym just before two very large black flying creatures pass overhead, hunting, without noticing them. As they stealthily continue, Chetney catches a strong odor of burning and sees burning trees southwest. They speculate the burning could be a fiendish entry point, and they spread out to look for Ashari tracks and flowers while moving that way. When they reach the burning trees, they find they have perpetually burning cinders within them in an area a little over 200 feet across. Orym approaches and notices some of them are damaged, as if by heavy movement. They speculate again it indicates an infernal entry point, and move away straight west.\n\nEventually they reach an ash marsh, the remnants of a forgotten battlefield, scattered with black stones. As Orym approaches, he notices a glimmer of blue, and Pâté's scouting discovers weapons and armored skeletal bodies in the area, as well as a small number of blue flowers in a small bush growing on top of a scorched stone surrounded by black crystals shaped somewhat like a hand or crown. The party is very suspicious, but Chetney moves forward to investigate and discovers about 30 of the flowers they seek growing on the bush. As he collects them, he uses Hunter's Bane and gets a tickle of an undead or fiendish presence. Orym, 40 feet away, notices two of the armored bodies nearby begin to move slightly, and can see they are not skeletal and ancient, but more recent. Behind them, a shadowy horned figure with glowing coal-like eyes sits on a rock, watching Chetney.\n\n![The devourer demon - Savs creates](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nChetney is growing increasingly uneasy and stuffs the six flowers he's harvested into the bag, standing to look back at Orym, who is staring past him at the horned figure. Orym gives him a thumbs-down, and Chetney turns, sees the horned figure, and keeps turning, trying to casually walk away while pretending to see nothing. The creature rises ominously to its full height and the two moving bodies snap upright. The rest of the party can now see them as well. Roll initiative!\n\nThe two shambling wights both move to Chetney, and one is able to grapple him. Disturbingly, he can tell they are both very recently deceased half-elves. FCG casts Compulsion on both and orders them to move toward the nearby mud, but the grappled Chetney is carried along. Imogen casts Watery Sphere at the horned devourer but it evades it, then sinks into the ground, emerging amid the party and creating a Soul Rend vortex of massive necrotic damage that hits Laudna, FCG, Fearne, and Orym, although the latter two save for half damage. They can see that inside its rib cage appears to be an imprisoned, screaming humanoid. Ashton starts a Gravity rage and is able to hit the large creature hard and knock it backward. Orym releases Chetney by slashing the wight holding him, but recognizes it as one of the missing Ashari. On his turn, Chetney assumes his full wolf form and attacks, while Fearne casts an Aura of Life and Laudna summons her Hound of Ill Omen (in the form of a skeletal wolf) to attack the demon that had been holding Chetney.\n\nThe dark mists form together into three wraiths that wound both Ashton and FCG, but Fearne's Aura halves the necrotic damage and prevents the loss of total hit points that would otherwise occur, while Laudna's Silvery Barbs saves FCG from a critical hit. One of the undead Ashari wights slashes Orym, and he ripostes, pushing it back and apologizing to his former comrade Turan. FCG summons their Spiritual Weapon and crits on a wight. Imogen's Watery Sphere captures one of the wraiths, and after deciding not to chance firing through Ashton's modified but untested crystal hammer and possibly hitting the party, Lightning Bolts both the devourer and the other wraith. The devourer, however, moves to Fearne and both his claw attacks hit for massive damage on her, followed by a Soul Rend hitting everyone but Orym, which is thankfully reduced by Fearne's Aura but puts her in single digit HPs. Orym moves her back with a Bait and Switch and he and Chetney both attack it. Orym recognizes the humanoid captive within its rib cage: Fira, a young Ashari. Chetney manages to grapple the devourer, and Fearne casts Daylight , lighting up the entire area. Laudna sends Pâté into the watery sphere and casts a twinned Shocking Grasp through him, killing two of the wraiths.\n\nThe last wraith, at disadvantage because of the Daylight , attacks Fearne and she goes down, along with her Aura of Life . FCG immediately casts Mass Cure Wounds on everyone, bringing her back to consciousness, then uses their Spiritual Weapon to hit a wight. Imogen's Witch Bolt finishes off the devourer and its last summoned wraith also disappears. The two wights, already near death, are quickly finished off.\n\nOrym moves to the remains of the fallen demon, and finds a blue glow within it. He reaches in, encountering no physical body but a faint fading energy of the Ashari Fira. With an open palm, he tries to give one last living contact. The energy forms into a young elven figure who places her hand on his, before moving on to her destination. They gather the personal effects of the three fallen Ashari to return to their families, and lay them to rest. The blue flowers growing in the area fill only about a third of their satchel, so they take a short rest in the shelter of the rocks, watching a hint of smoke rising in the direction they seek.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e66-aid_of_the_tempest"}

Fearne made a pact with a devil . Managed to save some survivors of both the overthrown bastion in the Grey Valley, and some of the original volunteers of the Air Ashari that had gone out to try to do this beforehand.\n\nGathering these things, as well as an interesting weapon that seems to be talking to you, you recovered over a night's rest, returned to Zephrah, and watched as indeed Keyleth was able to recover the majority of her strength within a short time, and speaking out to the people of Zephrah, giving thanks to your troop and specifically to you and those of Zephrah that put their lives on the line as well. Receiving a new title, and celebration ensuing here in the middle of Zephrah, you all spoke with her and figured out a number of possible paths in the future, one that involved discovering the strange broken harness that was found in the old tower of Ludinus over in Molaesmyr as well as strange power that seems to reside within Ashton that has a strong tie to the Primordial Titans that existed even before the gods arrived. Taking these possibilities in hand, you stepped out into the celebration of Zephrah.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party decides to take the rest of the day to do errands, make visits, and celebrate, and also decide their immediate goal is to fix Ludinus 's broken life-extending harness so they can go to the Shattered Teeth to suck up some energy to charge it. Chetney , Laudna , and Imogen decide to try out the skysails , Ashton goes off on their own to pick up their ordered new outfit, and Fearne and Fresh Cut Grass go with Orym to visit family.\n\n![Fearne and Orym by Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/0b/Fearne_and_Orym_by_Pyromeekorai.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230821185624)\n\nOn the way to Fanny Z 's, Ashton has a panic attack, but picks up their new outfit which features the Hishari symbol prominently. Orym, Fearne, and FCG visit his mother-in-law Nel . FCG asks her advice on making decisions. She agrees to visit Derrig and Will 's graves with them. There, Orym tells Derrig how much he misses his guidance and example and admits he doesn't know if he'll survive the coming battles. He greets Will, and tells him how good it was to briefly see him when Orym was slain by Otohan Thull . He admits he is scared by what lies ahead, and tells Will he'll see him soon.\n\n![Chetney's flying adventure - Lyadrielle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/73/Chetney%27s_flying_adventure_-_Lyadrielle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230820223514)\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna, Chetney, and Imogen head to a platform from which the skysails are launching and speak to the trainer, Ulli, about flying them. He eventually agrees to take Laudna and Chetney up individually in a training craft. As Laudna prepares to take off with him, she tells Imogen that if she dies doing this, Imogen should move on and find someone else, blurting out to Chetney that Imogen's her girlfriend now. Laudna does reasonably well with the trainer, but while they're gone, Chetney steals another skysail and takes off solo, joined by Imogen who has cast Fly on herself. Laudna wrests control from the trainer and gets into a dogfight with Chetney, who goes into a dive and is unable to pull out of it. Imogen flies after him, but this time Laudna isn't strong enough to get control away from her trainer. Balked, she uses Infestation to cast bees into his face and dives after Chetney as well, narrowly avoiding a collision. Chetney crashes into a henhouse, destroying the skysail, and Laudna successfully lands near him where the trainer sends them away.\n\nThe party rejoins and decides to go drinking at the Airy Eyrie. On the way, Orym picks up his new armor, which provides a bit more coverage than previously. Once at the bar, he buys the drinks and they all down them, with Ashton providing a stack of silver coins for FCG to imbibe as well. They chat a while, and discuss FCG finding out in the past few months that he is not unique, as he had thought. There is more talk of the gods and the various interactions they've recently had with them, but Ashton and Laudna both express that they want to pursue the Primordial path more. They talk a bit about the Titans and Ashton's link to them.\n\nLaudna slips out to watch the sunset, focusing on the purples and greens. Under her breath, she says, \"Delilah? Are you still there? I felt... a little pulse back in Issylra . So just curious.\" There is no answer. Imogen joins her, and Laudna admits the god talk made her want to check if Delilah Briarwood is back. In turn, Imogen admits that when Laudna died, Imogen reached out to Delilah for help and found her pretty useless. They experimentally call out to the Moonweaver but nothing happens. After sharing a kiss, they watch the darkness gathering over the village. Laudna feels a cold sensation on her shoulders and hears a voice in the back of her mind: \"No matter who you pray to, no matter who you reach for, you are, and will always be, mine.\"\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Bells Hells celebrating - Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6c/Bells_Hells_celebrating_-_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20230820223051)\n\nThe party continues drinking, while FCG and Fearne try smoking more cigarettes. When Chetney pulls his sword to use as a lighter, he again hears its voice in his mind, praising him as a great warrior and suggesting he's being duped by the dubious leader of the village, a member of the corrupt Council of Tal'Dorei . Graz'tchar warns him to be ready for anything.\n\nThe tipsy group returns to Alma 's cottage where she welcomes them for the evening. Fearne Scrys on Dancer with an interpretive dance, finding her drunkenly walking in a city that Fearne recognizes as Yios . FCG immediately decides that's where they'll go in the morning after talking to Keyleth . Orym unsuccessfully tries once more to use the Sending Stone to reach Caleb Widogast , and Laudna confirms the tracking ball shows no sign of Otohan Thull nearby. They all fall asleep.\n\nIn the morning, they go to Keyleth's home, and the sword once more warns Chetney not to trust her. They tell her their plans, and she suggests they consider doing a secret reconnaissance mission to Ruidus to gather intelligence. Meanwhile, Graz'tchar continues to whisper in Chetney's ear, suggesting he could end this right now, and that he should take his shot if he catches her alone. Keyleth suggests she could travel with them to Yios, then send them to their next destination from there. FCG continues to insist D didn't repair them; Dancer did. But since FCG chopped off her arm and killed her friends, getting her to help them will be a challenge. Keyleth reminds them she can repair severed limbs, and they agree to her plan. She leaves them to prepare.\n\nThe group confronts Chetney, who has been looking angrier and angrier, but he denies anything is wrong. The sword warns him to calm down. Keyleth returns and changes her appearance into a human woman, and FCG uses the Staff of Dark Odyssey to attempt to Teleport the party, but fails woefully and they all take damage before a second roll gets them to pre-dawn Yios. FCG casts Locate Creature and leads the way to a simple hostel where Dancer is apparently asleep upstairs. Imogen knocks, waking Dancer, who opens the door. As soon as she sees FCG, she attempts to shut the door again but fails, and FCG casts Calm Emotions on her. He attempts to convince her he's changed. Imogen adds they can regrow her arm, if she wants, but Dancer tells them she doesn't need to be fixed. FCG admits he can't move on unless he can close this chapter of his life. Dancer tells him she's moved on and he needs to do the same, but agrees to help repair the harness if she can, and FCG casts Lesser Restoration to help her hangover.\n\nAlong with her automatons Pussy II and Cookie, they go downstairs for coffee. Chetney shows her the broken harness, but it's beyond her ability to repair alone. However, she suggests Imahara Joe might be able to help, if they can transport her to Bassuras . While she's preparing to leave, Laudna introduces Pâté to Pussy, but it shoots a fire beam at him. They go outside to find a tree large enough to transport them, but on the way they hear an avian squawk from above, and the mangy form of Shithead flies toward them and defecates on FCG's head. Fearne kills it with Scorching Ray but it stirs back to life. FCG tries to eat it, but it's too large, and Imogen kills it again with Shocking Grasp . They frantically try to figure out how to kill it permanently, and Fearne casts Speak With Animals while FCG casts Identify , finding a very strong necromantic power within it. It tells Fearne FCG just seems unworthy and pisses him off. Its master is gone and it can't die, so it just shits on FCG, and it remembers its name: Gargo. It breaks free and FCG uses Turn Undead, killing it forever, but the effect also hits Laudna, who barely succeeds in resisting it.\n\nFCG has destroyed their nemesis, and takes this as a sign. They've reconnected with Dancer and the personification of their guilt is gone forever. FCG takes a few feathers and wears the drying birdshit as a victory badge.\n\nThe party reaches the Aydinlan Seminary where a guard stops them due to the pre-dawn hour but points them to another tree.

{"fields":{"title":"C3E70-Embattled in Bassuras","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , upon traversing the breadth of the Grey Valley to seek a means of aiding Keyleth from her unhealing wounds at the hands of Otohan Thull , during the moment of the Apogee Solstice , you bring her back to health, manage to peruse and cause a little bit of chaos in the Ashari city of Zephrah , get a little tipsy in an evening of winding down, and then trek out to Yios , where it was discovered via Scry spell that Dancer , the one responsible for repairing and bringing FCG online not but a handful of years back, seemed to have found themselves. In looking for someone to help you repair this strange arcane harness that you had recovered from the past of Ludinus Da'leth , you went to speak to her, and after a somewhat tense encounter within the city of Yios, the City of Flowing Light, you convinced her to help you out. Unfortunately, she needs more of a workshop to do the work, and even then, her knowledge is a bit incomplete for what this requires. It was spoken that perhaps teaming up with Imahara Joe over in the city of Bassuras would be enough to likely get this to a place where it could be helpful, or at least get any information you would need around its history and purpose.\n\nAfter being attacked by the ever-seeking Shithead , the bird which has claimed you as its primary focus of spite in its undying spirit, you finally laid it to rest, nothing but a pile of ash and feathers left behind. Keyleth coming along with you to aid you to the eventual discussed prospect of heading to the Shattered Teeth where it seems a number of ancient elemental power seems to still swirl and shift the numerous islands of the fog-shrouded broken continent to the far east, and mysteries that lie around the history and essence of one Ashton Greymoore might be tethered. With that in mind, Keyleth brought you through to an early morning tree in the central city of Bassuras here in the Hellcatch Valley . Here, under the reddish glow of the still and locked moon Ruidus , you walk through the pre-dawn streets.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nInside the city, the Gajakhandas are at high alert and there are many soldiers wearing Vasselheim uniforms, with three Othanzian skyships hovering overhead. As Orym watches, there is an apparent explosion on one but although soldiers and Gajakhandas run toward it, for the most part it's ignored by the populace which seems more focused on making money off the new arrivals to the city. A citizen they question tells them the soldiers have been in the city about a day and a half, heading north. Keyleth wild shapes into a bird and briefly scouts, identifying the forces as Vasselheim temple-affiliated. She volunteers to scout further and join back up later around noon.\n\nThe rest of the group heads to Imahara Joe 's, finding it dark and shuttered. There is no answer to their knock, and Chetney picks the lock. When Laudna calls out, they hear a thud and a strange voice within. Imogen uses Detect Thoughts to find nine minds within the building as a small glass globe rolls out and explodes into lightning damage. The party spreads out: FCG , Dancer , and Chetney stay in front, Fearne , Ashton , and Orym are in the back, while Laudna and Imogen go up onto the roof and find a grate looking inside. They see seven hostiles guarding two other figures (Joe and an unknown lagomore ), and Laudna Messages the others this information but is noticed. She takes 32 damage from a crossbow bolt and the battle begins.\n\n![Imahara Joe interior](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/30/Imahara_Joe_interior.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20230828143009)\n\nLaudna immediately retaliates with a Fireball . As the attackers move in, the party realizes that at least some of them are members of Paragon's Call , and General Ratanish is among them. The battle continues with the enemy dealing significant damage to the group, particularly Chetney. Looking through a window, FCG Banishes Ratanish, while Dancer uses her automaton Pussy II to cast Cure Wounds on Chetney.\n\nFCG holds concentration on Ratanish's Banishment through an attack by an enemy monk who is finished off by an Erupting Earth cast by his compatriot. FCG, also caught in the damage, is again able to barely maintain concentration. This turns the tide in Bells Hells' favor. A badly damaged Fearne is able to Charm one attacker, disarm him, and escape from him, while Chetney transforms into his werewolf form and manages to kill another of the enemy. FCG heals Chetney a bit more, and Orym blows up a couple of crawlers in for repair, killing a dragonborn.\n\nMister kills one of the few remaining combatants with a flame seed and Chetney kills another. FCG casts a Mass Healing Word on everyone but Orym, but the enemy caster wild shapes into a giant eagle and seizes both Joe and the lagomore in its claws. It is able to barely push through the door with its prisoners, taking attacks from both Fearne and Ashton on the way, and begins flying off. Ashton uses Wormhole Strike to attack the creature again, knocking it out of eagle form and sending the druid, Joe, and the lagomore plunging toward a spiked iron fence below.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Ashton gets the kill by Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/58/Ashton_gets_the_kill_by_Cha_Cha_Rae.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/320?cb=20230917100259)\n\nAshton uses Violent Gateway to teleport through the portal his Wormhole Strike created to reach Imahara Joe and grapple him, turning so that Ashton will absorb the brunt of the fall damage. Orym uses the Boots of Striding and Springing to jump up and do the same with the falling lagomore , while Imogen 's Telekinesis slightly flattens the fence so that they land across it rather than being impaled. Realizing that General Ratanish 's Banishment will end in seconds, the party gathers around the spot where he disappeared. When FCG drops the spell, they all attack. Orym gets the How do you want to do this? , with Ashton taking a final, bloody swipe through the body.\n\nMeanwhile, the neighbors are coming to investigate the sounds of battle, but Joe reassures them he's fine. They meet Verna the Viper , the lagomore, a friend and fellow tinkerer with Joe, and an expert in explosives. The party loots the bodies and puts them in the portable hole while Joe and Verna inspect the arcane leather harness . Joe explains that he and Verna were pressed into service by Paragon's Call after the Apogee Solstice to create enchanted objects and explosives. Joe suspects they were used against the arriving forces or the city itself. They were currently working on a brumestone nullifier. Verna and Joe quickly gather some tools, and the party leaves out the back just ahead of some approaching investigating Gajakhandas .\n\nThey head to Hondir 's old hideout, where Joe continues his inspection of the harness. He confirms the harness can channel energy from an object, place, or person into a wearer that is either inscribed with adaptation runes or shares a similar essence. This one is specific in its runic tuning but could potentially be adjusted by a powerful enchanter. It would take Joe and Verna about two weeks to repair, but they'd need tools and materials, including residuum . The party decides to ask Keyleth if she can provide transportation to somewhere for Joe and Verna to hide out and work on the harness. They decide Whitestone might be a good place, and Joe has actually heard of Percival de Rolo .\n\nMeanwhile, however, Ashton and Imogen head out, seeking information about Ashton's old fellow member of the Nobodies Pocket, but they have dropped out of sight. As an reluctant alternative, they head to the Palace of the All-Minds-Burn to talk to Justi Pross but run into Shady Sally there. Ashton tries to punch her when she claims to feel no guilt over abandoning him bleeding in the street after the failed burglary, and then uses Erratic Defense to slow and tip her over. Ashton tells her that after they spent years paying off the gang's debt to Jiana Hexum , it's payback time. The gang needs to unofficially get back together, because they're needed to combat the forces gathering with the Apogee Solstice . Justi is skeptical, but Ashton invites her into their mind, and she tells him there's someone she'd like Ashton to meet. Justi recommends they wear masks.\n\nImogen and Ashton follow Justi deeper down into the palace, and she tells them \"it\" asked for them. When Imogen slightly lowers her mental defenses, she senses a force pushing against her mind, strange and alien, fractured but unified. The air is bone dry, but a strong rotting smell is everywhere, and as they descend the stairs, they become soft and no longer stone. When they reach the cellar they see a 15 foot tall, faintly glowing mass of organic matter with skeletons bound within it. Justi tells them, \"This is us, or what brings us together.\"\n\nImogen reaches out mentally to the creature, asking how old it is. She receives the impression of hundreds of years. It isn't sure where it came from, but it wants to meet more. This is its home and it's hard to go further, but it lives through the eyes of those who take of it through the drugs they ingest. The being goes through Imogen's memories, and she senses it wants to help. It sees the dry, arid moonscape of the surface of Ruidus in her memories, and Imogen can sense its longing. The being splits, and a hard-shelled orange-sized object detaches, which Justi recognizes as the Brood Pit . Ashton picks it up, and Justi tells them, \"It wants to be seeded.\" The many members of All-Minds-Burn will help in the coming struggle, if they will leave the Brood Pit on the moon. They agree. As they leave, the other members of All-Minds-Burn bow their heads to them. On the street, they each express how good it is to feel as if they are making a difference.\n\n![Laudna's panic by Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/9b/Laudna%27s_panic_by_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230825194854)\n\nMeanwhile, back at the hideout, Laudna is panicking that Ashton and Imogen have been gone so long, when they arrive and tell the others what happened. When it is time to meet Keyleth, she tells them forces from across Exandria , including Vasselheim , are gathering in the Hellcatch Valley surrounding what they're calling the Bloody Bridge , and Keyleth has shared her information about the Reilorans . The troops' current orders are to hold for more information, but Keyleth believes the equilibrium will not last for long. She agrees to take Imahara Joe, Dancer , and Verna to Whitestone while they party goes to the Island of Slival to meet with Jirana , the Shore Shrew. After telling them Jirana can probably direct them to Evontra'vir , that the island sometimes \"burps\" due to the tide, and to say \"hi\" to Toriz, Keyleth opens a portal in the tree and Bells Hells runs through.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e70-embattled_in_bassuras"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E68-For The Tempest","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast time: Bells Hells , in prepping themselves for the coming growing threat in the Hellcatch Valley , in the echoes of the solstice and the Exandria -wide changes and damage that it's left in its wake, you went to ask aid of Keyleth after finding out that she had still continued to suffer the wounds that she was given in that moment by Otohan Thull . This specific toxin that she had used, this venom on her blades, prevented the wounds from closing and Keyleth near-incapacitated, unable to use her magic to weave these wounds away. You discovered that there is a particular type of flower that grows in places of severe corruption that, when gathered, could-- at least through previous experience-- possibly reverse this toxin. You followed shortly after a group of volunteers that went to the Grey Valley , and discovered they themselves had befallen some dark scenario upon attempting to recover these flowers, some of which fell and were corrupted in this field, others that were captured.\n\n![Fearne and Teven - ChaChaRae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/bf/Fearne_and_Teven_-_ChaChaRae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/275?cb=20230814221210)\n\nYou followed the trail to a bastion , a stronghold of followers of the Platinum Dragon that had fallen recently to a mass demon horde. Much was lost on each side, but victory laid with the demons and they were preparing for some larger ritual, a blood feast of some kind which these captured individuals were to be prepared for. You, using a two-pronged assault on this bastion, managed to slay many of these demons, ally with a devilish figure that seemed to also have a coincided interest against these demon forces, destroyed the local demon general of this region in this assault, and freed the remaining captives, three of which were members of the first Ashari volunteer party, one of which is Baernie , your Ashari sister. After realizing this space was dangerous, Fearne made a tiny, tiny pact with this devilish figure, Teven . Exhausted, hurt, and not immediately able to return back to Zephrah , Baernie carved through the stone magically an alcove in which you could rest for the evening. There, you gathered up, sealed the stone, and within this safe space, prepared yourselves for an evening's rest.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Chetney and the sword by Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/d3/Chetney_and_the_sword_by_Elaine_Tipping.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230814221302)\n\nAshton asks Chetney about the greatsword he found, and Fresh Cut Grass casts Identify on it. As he does, a voice comes into his mind telling him he has a great destiny dispelling darkness in the world, and suggesting they could act together for good. The sword tells FCG it was once a great king who has lost most of his memories, but has knowledge of the darker shadows creeping across the land. FCG gives the sword to a very skeptical Ashton, and it tells Ashton they have great possibilities and they could carry him for justice and good to wash the shadows from Tal'Dorei . Ashton is unimpressed with the sword's account of its past, and gives it back to FCG to cast Legend Lore . FCG learns that its apparent radiance is a curtain hiding its evil, corrosive nature doing the Prince 's will, but he hands the sword back to Chetney and says nothing of this, simply saying that the sword is very powerful. Chetney is enthusiastic, and FCG feels guilty and warns him the sword may not be quite what it seems: it might be a Demon Prince . The sword assures Chetney that's just lingering traces from its previous wielder. The others are dubious.\n\n![Avandra is worth saving by Lady Rossë](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/57/Avandra_is_worth_saving_by_Lady_Ross%C3%AB.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230829163548)\n\nThe group goes to sleep, and Imogen dreams of floating above the familiar red storm, seeing a city carved into the rocks with hundreds of humanoids within it. She feels a yearning pull and hears her mother's voice: \"Imogen, please, run! I won't let it have you.\" Imogen chooses to fight the pull, asking how she can trust her mother, and sees below her the surface of the red moon , cracked and dry but holding its own ecology. An ethereal Liliana approaches, saying she just wants to protect Imogen. When Imogen questions if she is really going to release Predathos to destroy the gods , Liliana tells her, \"You deserve to be free.\" Imogen is pulled from the dream. Meanwhile, FCG casts Commune , asking The Changebringer if the gods can help his friends: \"Yes.\" Are you worth saving: \"Of course.\" Are you scared? \"Yes.\"\n\nIn the morning, Chetney has attuned to the greatsword and Baernie opens the cave doorway. Imogen shares her vision of Ruidus with the others, telling them she is now convinced she wants to aid the gods and sever any connection to Predathos. Her mother is supporting Ludinus Da'leth , who wants the gods dead. FCG shares his Commune with the others, saying that the road he was on in his vision seemed to lead upward. Imogen agrees it seems they need to go to the moon. Chetney checks with Graz'tchar , learning the greatsword has never heard of Predathos but vaguely remembers Ludinus from when he was a king as being powerful and smart, but untrustworthy. Chetney takes this as confirming the sword is not evil.\n\nThe area holds several flying demons picking through the remains of the battle. The party stealths through to the nearest tree, but then realize if they load FCG, Fearne , Laudna , and Chetney into the portable hole , Imogen can Teleport them all back to Zephrah. They arrive and immediately open the hole to safely release the others, then go to Keyleth 's home where they are greeted by Leeta . Multiple herbalists converge on them, taking the satchels of blue perennem flowers off to create a healing paste from them. Among them is Nel , Orym 's mother-in-law, who greets him affectionately before getting to work.\n\n![Orym in the balcony by Cha Cha Rae](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe herbalists take the paste to Keyleth, where they apply it to her wounds, and when she adds dried leaves and colored dust, and activates it with her magic, her wounds slowly heal and she gains strength enough to sit up and put on her antlered crown. Looking at Orym, she thanks him before excusing herself for a few minutes to address the gathering villagers. Thollo returns to ask Orym to join the Voice on the balcony, and the others push him forward. Keyleth thanks him, Baernie, and the Tempest Blades who were with them, and Orym briefly addresses the crowd on their behalf: \"Hearts and minds, always Ashari, home and abroad, morning and night. Kaitiakè.\"\n\nA celebration begins, as Keyleth invites the party to join her to ask any questions or give any news they may have. FCG asks Orym if he plans to include \"bad news\" in the discussion, as well. As the party enters Keyleth's chambers to find the Tempest leaning heavily on her bed, Keyleth remarks that her recovery is not \"as quick as [she] had hoped.\"\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nKeyleth offers them any help she can give. She has sensed a shift in the magical weave across Exandria , and has heard that Ruidus is tethered above Marquet , temples have mobilized and armies have gone there, and there has been unrest including attacks on temples. Although Team Issylra looks uneasy, they do not admit their part in one such attack. Ludinus Da'leth has been seen in the Dwendalian Empire meeting with King Dwendal , who has been bedridden and reclusive for many years, and Keyleth believes the Empire is on the brink of chaos. Similarly, Vasselheim is pulling in its forces behind its walls, which buys Ludinus more time for what he's planning. Many forces that had been previously kept in balance are seizing this opportune moment.\n\nOrym shares with Keyleth the vision that several of them had in the Temple of the Matron of Ravens of the screaming orb in the Malleus Key . Keyleth's eyes dart to an empty perch on the balcony, and when Fearne and Laudna question her about her relationship with the gods, she tells them that she keeps them at arm's length but understands their importance in keeping balance in the world. Ashton admits they formed a temporary alliance with a Champion of Asmodeus , which takes Keyleth aback. She warns them not to get too close to the enemy, even if they are temporarily on the same side.\n\n![Reilora - Natasha Harris](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nImogen tells Keyleth there is a city on Ruidus , which comes as something of a shock to her, and Imogen Summons a Crimson Shade , noticing that it is slightly more \"physically present\" than in the past. She tries to question it, but it is evasive, saying that it wants only to serve her until her binding is done. When she asks its name, she receives a vision of a pale grey flower bearing a cut sapphire in its center that tinkles like a bell in the wind. Imogen asks if the reilora are happy about the recent events, and sees images of a verdant land filled with joy as it says, \"We know your dreams.\" It says that Predathos is \"The Progenitor\", the heart of their world, and it is stirring. Imogen then dismisses it, telling the others she suspects the reilora are jealous of life on Exandria . Laudna tells Keyleth that based on what they know, they suspect the reilorans were once humanoids living on Exandria, removed from it when the gods created Ruidus .\n\nOrym asks for Keyleth's advice on what they should do, and she is frank that she doesn't know, but they should do something. They should seek out help from everyone and anyone they can and bring them together when it's time. Ashton asks her about the Hishari , and admits he was born to them. Keyleth takes his hand and focuses, and tells him he carries both rare powers she recognizes, and others she does not. He carries a fragment of Primordial elemental capability, which she describes as a \" titan of blood \". Ashton shows her the symbol on the back of his jacket, and Keyleth confirms it to be the symbol of the Hishari. Their leader, Efterin , claimed to have journeyed far and acquired the blessing of Evontra'vir . Keyleth is uncertain how Ashton is coping with containing the power of both dunamancy and the Primordials . She thinks for him to exist, the Hishari must have had something of power holding the essence of the ancient Primordials, and the only place they could have gotten it would be Evontra'vir, the Great Tree of Atrophy, a powerful ancient tree spirit whose roots wind between life and death to watch over the cycle of renewal. It is on the island of Kalutha in the Shattered Teeth . Evontra'vir was once a Gau Drashari who then became a part of the land by becoming a tree.\n\nThe party discusses potential allies, but most are busy elsewhere. They talk about where they might tap into elemental power. Keyleth has been to the Shattered Teeth once, to the island of Slival grieving the loss of the love of her life . She met with Jirana , an expert in mourning and loss, who helped her deal with her pain. She offers to send Bells Hells there via magic, if they choose. There are no maps, because the islands seem to shift over time, and there is a huge volume of residual elemental magic left from the annihilation of two Primordial Titans there.\n\nThey show Keyleth Ludinus' harness, and she confirms he used it to draw energy from fey creatures, who are tightly linked to the nature spirits, mimicking the druidic means of extending life. The harness is broken, but could potentially be repaired. She also assures them that the means of ascending is probably impossible to acquire these days, because of Vox Machina 's defeat of the Whispered One , leaving a massive Primordial Earth Titan looming over Vasselheim. When Laudna hears the name of the Whispered One, a cold jolt shoots down her spine. The only people who would now retain knowledge of the Ritual of Seeding would be the Champion of the Matron of Ravens , and the Matron herself, but so far Ludinus hasn't seemed interested in Ascension, only in freeing mortals from the gods forever.\n\nOrym points out that they know very little for certain about either the reilorans or Predathos, and Imogen suggests she could give in to the pull she feels when she connects to Ruidus to learn more of Predathos. They try to think who might be able to repair the harness, and Imogen suggests D , the aeormaton who sold FCG to Dancer , although they know only that it extends life, not that it grants more power. FCG Scrys on D and locates them somewhere on the Menagerie Coast , but FCG points out that Dancer reactivated them, not D. Their Scry on Dancer reveals her sleeping, with no way to tell where. FCG cast Divination and asks where to go to get the harness repaired, but the answer is: \"The path with one from your past you are most bound to.\" This could be either, so FCG casts again, asking if he's more bound to Dancer or D. The answer is, \"The path to the mind of that which gave you life renewed,\" which is still enigmatic. Ashton tries to convince FCG that meeting D would let them make a new friend. On the third try, the answer is \"The one whose name begins with a D.\" FCG gives in to the urging of the others and decides to visit D.\n\nThey decide to spend the rest of the day running errands and Teleport in the morning. Before they leave, Keyleth thanks them once more, and addresses Orym directly, reminding him that he is not alone and that the strength of his people will rally behind them. She urges him to find the strength to take the first step forward, and gives him the title \"Savior Blade of the Tempest\". Orym says he'll try to do her, and Derrig , proud.\n\nImogen gives FCG the Staff of Dark Odyssey to attune to so he can Teleport them in the morning, and they step out into the celebrating populace of Zephrah.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e68-for_the_tempest"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E61-Crisis of Faith","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, this half of Bells Hells , upon discovering some other oddly scattered figures here in the midst of the Apogee Solstice , have come together in the wilds in the center of the continent of Issylra . Upon trying to find a means of gathering where they are and where to go, they traverse one of the nearby roads before eventually coming to the town of Hearthdell . Here in Hearthdell, they meet some of the populace who seem to be a bit tense by a somewhat robust church appearance of the nearby temple of the Dawnfather on the north side of the city, as well as Judicators that have been bringing with them a larger religions presence, an ominous one, to a town that itself prides its people on a less temple-centric life. Asking some questions, finding out about some of the events that have transpired here surrounding the solstice, as well as the nexus of the leylines that lies above the city, you asked some questions, made some allies, until eventually you were introduced to the Elder Joan Abaddina .\n\nYou spoke with her a bit, asking for information about possibly Scrying for information on locations or people you wish to know about, and also discovered the burgeoning, boiling frustration of the townsfolk that currently continue to choke at the yoke of the temple and those within, and the figures from Vasselheim and their wishes to pull them away from their paganistic beliefs, especially during this time period. You were then invited to meet with a secretive town gathering beneath the local brewery. There, you saw a rising angry tide of locals who, underneath guidance of this elder, see the opportunity of a distracted religious structure, the events that are transpiring in Marquet pulling their eyes and ears and interest away. Now, with the swelling power and influence of the solstice apparently enhancing the capabilities of the local eidolons , the spirits that protect this land, they are attempting to attack the temple, raze it, and send the people they dislike from within far from their village to never return. Upon asking if you are with or against them, you told them you were with them. You helped them plan their approach and possible assault, and after some conversation, the expression of some drinks that were a bit tampered with, and some modicum of successful and non-successful banter, tensions began to reach a breaking point, at which point the guards were assaulted, the cart in which you arrived was shattered, the alarm was sounded, and now the temple is beginning to prepare itself for some sort of a scuffle.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nPrism and Deni$e have transported inside the Temple, while Bor'Dor , Orym , Laudna and Ashton (as well as the villagers) remain outside as the guards sound the alarm. Orym uses Seedling to shoot Grasping Vines at Flameguide Kiro and pull her off the temple tower to the ground, where she shouts, \"What is this? We built this for you!\" Ashton enters a Possibility rage, but Kiro uses Hold Person on both Ashton and Orym, paralyzing them. The others attack, joined by Joan Abaddina who summons an Earth Guardian to destroy the temple gate, but the guards fight back. Laudna casts Silvery Barbs to negate a crit against Orym, and Bor'Dor urges the townsfolk to storm the temple gate.\n\nAshton kills one of the multiple temple guards and joins Orym in attacking Kiro, who tries to run and then summons a Guardian of Faith . Laudna Spider Climbs inside the temple to join Prism and Deni$e fighting the powerful Judicator. Right about now, the laxative Bor'Dor gave several of the guards earlier kicks in, and they are poisoned, at disadvantage and in pain. Bor'Dor hits Kiro with a critical hit from his crossbow, then stabs her in the neck, finishing her off. He catches some of the blood in his hand as she falls, but he starts vomiting. Kiro's Guardian kills several of the invading villagers before it fades out of existence upon her death. Meanwhile, Laudna uses Silvery Barbs once again to negate a crit, this one against Deni$e, who has taken the brunt of the Judicator's attacks and is seriously wounded.\n\n![Laudna's Hound - @cpprcoyote](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/95/Laudna%27s_Hound_-_%40cpprcoyote.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230612215358)\n\nThose still outside move into the interior of the temple and join the others already battling there. Deni$e takes down another guard, while Laudna summons a Hound of Ill Omen to attack the Judicator. When the Elder sees Kiro's body, she is horrified, shouting, \"Take them prisoner, do not kill them!\" However, when she sees the Judicator, she joins the attacks against him with a Blight . Suddenly, light fills the chamber and a deep voice echoes from above: \"Leave, or be judged.\" A winged, golden-feathered glowing figure descends holding a fiery longsword, striking at and hitting both Ashton and Prism, then uses Fiery Castigation against Orym, telling him, \"Repent,\" and wrapping him in restraining fiery golden chains. Meanwhile, Prism sends Mother to Bor'Dor to collect Kiro's blood from him, then uses it to Summon Greater Demon . The summoned barlgura appears in the air directly above the Dawnborn Angel , falling on top of him before attacking him. Seeing this, the surviving guards run away into the arms of the attacking villagers outside. The Judicator attacks multiple times, hitting Deni$e with another critical and bringing her dangerously close to unconsciousness.\n\nThe rest of the party begins to concentrate most of their attacks against the extremely hard-hitting Judicator, while Abaddina casts a Mass Cure Wounds , which unfortunately just misses Deni$e. The angel rises into the air, casting a Fireball that hits Laudna, Bor'Dor, and Abaddina for massive damage, causing Abaddina to lose control of the Earth Guardian. Prism casts Steel Wind Strike through Dynios , hitting both the angel and the Judicator and bringing the Judicator close to unconsciousness. On its turn, after attacking Ashton it tries to run, and the attacks of opportunity by both the barlgura and Laudna's hound finish it off. Only the angel and the now freed earth elemental remain on the battlefield.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Ashton's attack by Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/ea/Ashton%27s_attack_by_Cha_Cha_Rae.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230615165125)\n\nOrym looks up at the angel hovering above and climbs onto the back of the barlgura , shortly joined by Deni$e . Ashton is able to communicate with the Earth Guardian in Primordial , asking it to throw Ashton toward the flying angel. It complies and Ashton recklessly attacks in the air, but takes a counterstrike from the angel and damage from the fall. When the angel attempts another Fireball , Laudna Counterspells . The barlgura climbs up a pillar and then leaps, and its passengers Orym and Deni$e are able to each get in a hit on the angel before the barlgura grapples it and brings them all crashing to the ground. As the angel looks at him with pity, Bor'Dor walks over and casts Inflict Wounds , saying, \"Enough,\" as he grasps the angel's head and kisses its forehead. The angel slowly crumbles and burns away into ash.\n\nThe remaining temple guards are quickly captured and subdued by the villagers, and as the second Judicator approaches, it sees the situation, turns, and leaves. Eidolons begin to fill the temple, and at Elder Abaddina 's direction, the elemental seizes the demon in a bearhug, crushing it down into a sphere until they both crumble into shale. The vines growing around the temple tighten, beginning to crush the stone. Orym searches the fallen Judicator, learning that its mask is actually a part of its face. Laudna confronts Abaddina silently, saying nothing but looking at her intently where she is joined by Deni$e, and the Elder warns them they should get outside the vine-engulfed temple. Meanwhile, the villagers round up the guards and those villagers who had converted and come to the temple's defense, taking them to the edge of town. Prism searches the temple and finds thousands of coins, religious texts, and scrolls, which Ashton puts in the portable hole .\n\nFinished looting, the party leaves the temple, but Laudna and Deni$e remain with Abaddina, still staring at her. As stones and cracked glass begin to fall from the ceiling, Abaddina leaves and they follow. The roots and trees crush the temple into a pile of rubble to the cheers of the villagers. Orym is processing this, caught by the contradiction of destroying the temple of a seemingly good god in their efforts to stop a person who wants to destroy all the gods.\n\nAbaddina addresses the captives, freeing them and giving them the choice to flee, or stay and pay their debts. All but one opt to head northward, toward the road. She thanks the party for their help and heals Deni$e and Bor'Dor, telling them she must sleep before Scrying for them per their arrangement. As the villagers' celebration begins, Bor'Dor confirms his owed favor to Proleff has been paid, and realizes he has very mixed feelings about the death of the angel. The others agree that, although they are not entirely comfortable with what has happened, it was a net good.\n\nPrism and Ashton give Abaddina the tithed money they found in the temple, and she gives it to Proleff to distribute as he sees fit. Orym takes Laudna aside and expresses his concerns. She suggests allowing the villagers to remain ignorant and happy, although she, too, is frustrated and angry. Orym reiterates the urgency of getting back to Marquet , and his sense of futility that they can do anything to stop the looming disaster. But he wants to find the people they care about first.\n\nAbaddina invites the party to stay with her for the night, revealing her exhaustion as she leads them to her cottage and makes tea for them as they talk. Abaddina claims to know nothing of Predathos or its nature, but the eidolons which she and the villagers revere are the remnants of the great elemental titans . Prism suggests that Predathos may be a threat to them, as well, and the rest of the party agrees that they desperately need to learn more. Abaddina, however, tells them that the eidolons sense no threat from Ruidus or from Predathos. She retires for the night, and Laudna asks Ashton if they think Abaddina may know more about their origins. Ashton doesn't think so, but plans to ask the party for help in pursuing their past once things settle down. They, however, are as angry as Orym and Laudna are. This was the first time a god, a messenger, actually saw them, and the message they took from it was that \"she\" doesn't care; that Ashton might as well be gone; that they're a mistake.\n\nMeanwhile, Orym has gone outside alone and climbed a tree. Bor'Dor comes outside, looking for him, and Orym calls down to him. When Bor'Dor asks if he wants to talk, Orym invites him to climb up with him, and once in the tree, they talk about the gods, Orym's belief that his friends and family are what he cares about rather than gods, and Bor'Dor's sadness and compassion for the angel he killed. Bor'Dor questions what they're doing here with so much more at stake, and Orym replies that they have a small chance of preventing more people he cares about from being killed. Bor'Dor agrees that's a good goal, telling him, \"I go where you go,\" as he shakes his hand.\n\nPrism and Laudna read through the documents recovered from the temple, which reveal the priests were planning further expansion. They also discuss the coming Apogee Solstice and Vasselheim 's buildup of forces near nexus points in anticipation. Prism and Laudna realize the elders probably understand that the surge of magical energy near the village caused by the nexus overhead will likely bring many more years of outside interest in the area; hence, the urgency to oust them while they could.\n\nThe entire party, except Orym, get a long rest. In the morning, Ashton asks Abaddina if she knows anything about his condition, but she does not, and suggests he speak to the elemental spirits. She leads them to the Scrying basin where Orym produces the wooden box Chetney made for him. Within the pool, they see snow falling on a mountain range, the figures of Deanna and F.R.I.D.A. (whom they do not know), and of Chetney , Imogen , Fearne , and FCG walking through the snow toward a nearby mountain city which Prism recognizes as Uthodurn because of Kravaraad in the distance. They discuss how they can get there and Abaddina suggests that four or five days north in the Irriam Canyon is a shrine kept by Hevestro , Hierophant of the Emerald Tree, a powerful archdruid, who may be able to help them. Or they could go to Vasselheim.\n\n![Scrying on the Crown Keepers by Taylor Weltzer](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/13/Scrying_on_the_Crown_Keepers_by_Taylor_Weltzer.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/320?cb=20230624153744)\n\nDeni$e pulls a lock of hair from her cleavage and asks for another Scry . This time, they see a worried Dariax sitting in a dark space, with Dorian behind him. Prism urges Bor'Dor to Scry on his brother, but he doesn't have an object belonging to him. Eventually, he uses his dagger, which at least comes from his home. The Scry reveals a modest but well-furnished homestead, unfamiliar to Bor'Dor. Abaddina gives Prism a beautiful scroll containing the Scry spell so she will be able to cast the spell herself in the future, and summons a wind eidolon in the form of a semi-ethereal cougar to guide and accompany them on their journey. She wishes them well, and asks they spread word of the village's success to any others of the Valley Coalition they may encounter. As the sun ascends higher in the sky, they set off in the direction of Hevestro and the Irriam Canyon.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e61-crisis_of_faith"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E62-A Long Walk of Reflection","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Our troop of ragtag, thrown-together, circumstantial heroes and friends have been wandering the center of Issylra . It is here, in the Demithore Valley , that they encountered a village beneath one of the nexus points of the now seemingly continuous Apogee Solstice , upon which you freed the local villagers of what seemed to be an oppressive influx of the Dawnfather faith, the temple encroaching and pressing its will upon the people as well as the worship. Through relatively violent means,  stormed the temple, and helped them and the guardian spirits of the land, the eidolans , to destroy the temple and send the surviving faithful to the Dawnfather away, not to return.\n\nIn thanks, the people celebrated, and the local elder, Abaddina , granted you some scrying of your requests before sending you onto the next leg of what you seek, which is a means to return home, or at least for some of you, return to the people that are your home. As part of that gift, Abaddina sent a guide spirit, one of the smaller eidolons in the form of a wind cougar that is guiding you towards your destination, an individual named Hevestro , the Hierophant of the Emerald Tree that resides to the far north within the Irriam Canyon , told if you follow the precipice in the distance of the Ascendant Bridge Mountain about four or five days' travel, you should reach the chasm that is the canyon. Within there, a shrine awaits, surrounded by blue flora.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nIn the morning, the party sets out from Hearthdell northward toward the Irriam Canyon . As they go, Prism mentions her summoning of the demon during the battle and checks to see if anyone was made uncomfortable by this. Ashton liked it. They talk about Bor'Dor 's new-found powers and encourage him to practice as they travel deeper into the Serratus Wilderness , making camp at nightfall after Pâté , Mother , and Dynios scout out a suitable location.\n\n![Ashton and Orym by Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1f/Ashton_and_Orym_by_Cha_Cha_Rae.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/320?cb=20230620155512)\n\nBor'Dor forages berries and Deni$e hunts a rabbit for dinner. Ashton asks Orym for advice on meditation, admitting that the last few days \"kind of threw\" them and they're trying to recenter, and they agree to support each other through what lies ahead. Orym massages Ashton's hand pressure points, trying to relieve their pain a bit. Experimentally, Prism carves runes into Bor'Dor's crossbow, discovering that they would allow it to be enchanted in a limited way prior to battle although leaving it slightly charred. They make a practice dummy for Bor'Dor and he practices shooting Fire Bolt at it. In an effort to help Ashton meditate, Bor'Dor casts Calm Emotions on Ashton, making him feel very good and wander off to talk to a rock. Seeing the effect, Bor'Dor casts it on everyone else as well and they get an excellent night's sleep (Bor'Dor curled up with the wind cougar). Ashton takes the first watch, continuing to practice their meditation.\n\nAfter a long rest, the next day of travel is uneventful. They come across a 15-foot grown-over crater in the ground, and Orym Druidcrafts flowers similar to those growing in the crater as the party descends into it. They notice an ancient petrified skeleton embedded in its wall. Ashton merges with the stone and with the assistance of Deni$e's ability to cleave stone and Laudna 's decorative worn rock chisel they pull the skull free. Prism Identifies it as a githzerai from the Astral Sea , placed within a long-ago meteor as a punishment. They recover a ring from its finger, which Prism Identifies as a Ring of Volcanic Flesh and Ashton keeps.\n\n![Orym's Zeph'aeratum - Odd](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6d/Orym%27s_Zeph%27aeratum_-_Odd.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230619010957)\n\nThat night, Ashton pulls out his Pipe of Remembrance and loans it to Prism. The smoke reveals the moment of her past she considers the most heroic was being invited by a visiting mage to leave the Shadow Realm and train with the Cobalt Soul in Exandria . While on watch, Orym notices soft, glowing, comforting eyes watching him in the darkness and wisps of small sprite-like spirits moving and drifting in the smoke of the campfire. He wakes Prism and she identifies them as local spirits, playfully sharing the space with them. She casts Bigby's Hand , lifting Orym up so he can dance with them, performing a weaponless Zeph'aeratam among the firefly-like sprites and reflecting on the need to appreciate beauty and joy amid even the worst of times.\n\nIn the morning, their travel takes them just outside the Serratus Wilderness itself, skirting the forest in beautiful rolling grass-covered hills. Bor'Dor asks Laudna about the person in their earlier Scry on Team Wildemount that seemed more important to her than the others: Imogen . Laudna says they've been together for two or three years before meeting the rest of Bells Hells , and she feels as though they are \"sisters from another mister\". She worries about the effect the Apogee Solstice may have had on her, since Imogen is Ruidusborn . Bor'Dor agrees to try another Scry on his brother, this time using a sling that everyone in the household used. Bor'Dor is secretly afraid his brother is dead, and is not reassured when the Scry reveals only the cabin which he identifies as the place where his brother stays, but his brother is nowhere in sight.\n\nThat evening, Prism attempts a Scry on Ludinus Da'leth , but is unsuccessful. Bor'Dor goes fishing and catches a tiny one that Prism casts Enlarge on. Laudna asks Bor'Dor how he's doing, and he responds that he's afraid the group, even with their \"more powerful\" friends, won't be enough to kill a god killer . He asks how many they killed while trying to stop Ludinus, hoping they got enough and asking if they're trying to take down Predathos , or just stop Ludinus. They decide they need to focus on Ludinus and on getting back to their friends, and Laudna suggests that perhaps some change to Exandria is inevitable. But they know too much to simply walk away from the problem. During their watch together, Ashton loans the Pipe of Remembrance to Bor'Dor, whose most heroic memory is of succeeding in casting a Fire Bolt a few days ago, feeling like he belongs for the first time. Later, Orym wakes, planting Seedling point-down in the ground and adorning the hilt with flowers. He addresses the Wildmother , telling her he's heard much about  the good she and the other gods have done and asking for her aid.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nIn the morning, Deni$e succeeds in an unrevealed act of sleight-of-hand without being noticed by the target. [1] After a number of hours, they reach the edge of a wide crevasse surrounded by trees which their guiding wind cougar proceeds down into. Prism enlarges Mother into the size of the hawk and Orym hang glides down on her, narrowly avoiding a crash but spotting some blue flora in the distance to the northeast. The others leap off the edge, caught by Laudna 's Feather Fall but taking some injuries from the slanting cliff wall. [2]\n\nAt the bottom, Prism sends Dynios to explore behind a waterfall, and he returns wet and unhappy, finding nothing. Deni$e's Whip of Warning is faintly warm, so they proceed cautiously, passing a muddy hill near the water crowned with vibrant flowers. Prism notices that something about the hill seems off, and Pâté discovers both that the flowers are illusory and that there is a hidden cavern entrance in a crack in the canyon wall behind it with writing in Primordial inscribed into it. Deni$e's whip is now hot, so with Pass Without Trace they cautiously approach. As they pass the hill, they hear a deep breathing and notice the whole hill seems to be slightly moving as it does, but it doesn't notice them pass by.\n\nThey reach the blue plant growth which surrounds the cavern, noticing prismatic crystals emerging from small cracks and wreathing the entrance. Ashton reads the inscription around the entrance: \"Within the Verdant Tomb, we keep her spirit enduring.\" Bor'Dor picks up one of the loose crystals, and when Prism experimentally casts Ray of Frost through it, it splinters the spell and refracts it into nine smaller rays, narrowly missing the party. Having led them this far, the wind cougar disappears. They decide not to take any more crystals but to move deeper into the cavern.\n\nThey move stealthily inward to a 40-foot wide chamber holding living quarters for a small community with branching tunnels and six alcoves naturally formed in the rock. It appears orderly and recently untouched. Straight ahead, the main cavern descends further and they notice bare elven or half-elven footprints leading into and out of it. Bor'Dor yells into it, introducing himself, but there is no response. They move lower, passing planters filled with soil and vibrant blue plants, and decorative metal support arches.\n\nThe passageway widens into another majestic chamber filled with green light. A central platform climbs in natural mineral steps, and multiple light-refracting crystals fill the walls. At the apex of the platform is a glowing green 12-foot monolithic crystal obelisk that appears shaded or obscured in its center. Recent ritual runic marks and drawings fill in those places on the walls not bearing crystals, which Prism recognizes as ritualistic markers used to channel magical energies. The chamber is not only a shrine, but has been prepared for some event. Ashton notices the crystals look very much like residuum , and Orym notices the shadowed space in the crystal looks as if it could hold a body. Looking up, among the crystals on the ceiling he sees a face. As he meets its eyes, it smiles.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e62-a_long_walk_of_reflection"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E64-Reunited","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, Team Wildemount : After being one half of Bells Hells ' cast and scattered troop over to the continent of Wildemount , re-engaging with a member of Chetney 's past, Deanna and her companion F.R.I.D.A. , discovering some of the strange changes in the world and the surrounding ways that magic seems to function both new and old because of the Apogee Solstice and the recent events, you managed to go past and succeed across some challenges. You traveled from the city of Uthodurn to the ruined and cursed township of Molaesmyr in the center of the Savalirwood , absconded with information from the past of Ludinus Da'leth himself, and survived. And some of you got freaky. But after some rest and a newly-acquired staff , you chose to Teleport yourselves back to Jrusar with your two new companions in tow. Upon rolling your d100 for the teleportation, you rolled extremely low.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe story picks up at the end of Team Wildemount's last episode . Hurtling through dimensional space, the party is damaged by psychic forces in two distinct waves before eventually coming to rest in a new location. (OOC: Laura rolled a 5 on the Teleport at the end of \" Escape From The Past \" (3x58) which caused the party to take 18 points of damage. On her re-roll, she rolled a 4 for another 15 damage. On her third try, she rolled a 13, placing the party in a similar location to their intended destination.) Deanna casts Mass Cure Wounds on the battered group, and they find themselves high in a mountainous area on a cliffside that they soon realize is still on Wildemount far to the southwest of the Greying Wildlands , [1] rather than their intended destination, Marquet . They are approached by a group of large, armed bird-people ( eisfuura or aarakocra ) to whom they attempt to surrender but several of them are caught in thrown nets. Surrounded by large birds, Fresh Cut Grass grows increasingly nervous. Imogen attempts to explain it was a failed Teleport and eventually the party convinces their captors that they just want to leave. FCG is growing increasingly distraught, which F.R.I.D.A. notices and contacts him telepathically, calming him slightly. They are blindfolded and flown away, but FCG's stress level tips over into rage. Imogen uses her telekinetic ability to pull down her blindfold and sees this, so casts Calm Emotions on the aeormaton. While he is rational, he continues casting it on himself until they are all landed. They are told if they return they'll be killed. The birdfolk then fly off.\n\nFCG is still rage-filled and continuing to self-cast Calm Emotions . FRIDA kisses him and he is calmed very slightly, enough to regain control. Imogen's Staff of Dark Odyssey needs to recharge overnight before it can cast Teleport again, so the party takes a long rest. While FCG is in stasis, FRIDA casts Detect Thoughts on him, delving deep to discover within him an intrusive but immovable intent to kill, destroy, and cleanse, added by someone building and enchanting something deep within FCG's body.\n\n![Pretty - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/8b/Pretty_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230710185631)\n\nIn the morning, Imogen uses the Staff to successfully transport the party to the Smolder Spire of Jrusar , which is in the still-dark very early morning. They notice an unusual military presence in the city and that many of the magical lights of the town are diminished. Deanna successfully casts Scry on Laudna using the blood in Imogen's Bloodwell Vial , finding her safe and alive in a cave chamber. Imogen then tries Sending but it again fails, and they decide they should check to see if the others left word at any of the places they used to frequent. They go to the Soot and Swill tavern and check in with Pretty , who hasn't seen the others but tells them about recent events during the Apogee Solstice . The city's a little hard to get around in now since some of the gondolas have stopped working.\n\nAs the sun rises, they can now see the Aerie Skyport as well as some of the nearby mountains are full of skyships and battleships and there is a large military presence from all over Exandria . They reach the non-working gondola and find a long queue for the small replacement brumeskipper , so use their letter from the King and Queen of Uthodurn to bypass the line. Fearne wildshapes into a raccoon dog and is carried so they'll all fit, and despite a nervous journey and Imogen's fear of heights, they reach the Core Spire safely.\n\nThey pass multiple international soldiers who are nervous, frustrated, and confused, on the way to the Spire by Fire Inn , where they are greeted by Ishir . Ishir hasn't seen the other party members, but serves them breakfast. While they wait, Imogen Sends to Zhudanna , asking if she's seen Laudna. The message goes through but Zhudanna is confused and hasn't seen her.\n\nMeanwhile, Chetney chats with some of the soldiers getting breakfast in the Inn. They know very little, only that they were sent to Jrusar very suddenly and that command seems to be decentralized. When Fearne, still in raccoon dog form, goes over and eavesdrops, she hears much the same thing: they're supposed to be sent to run a perimeter around the \"grounding site\" but that's all they'll be told till they get there. Deanna rents a room in Bells Hells' name and leaves a note to Team Issylra that they're there and safe, and will return. FRIDA asks Imogen how she's doing, and assures her that they'll find the others soon. Imogen gives FRIDA a hug while FCG glares at them jealously, and telepathically accuses Imogen of being a hussy.\n\nElsewhere in the city, a tree glows and a portal opens within it.\n\n### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nAs Team Issylra , after traversing the challenges and dangers of the center of Issylra 's continent, heading toward the Ascendant Bridge Mountain , making some allies, destroying some temples, traversing the dangers of the natural world, learning of the eidolon spirits, being betrayed, but then, with some information gathered and rest under your belt, you were granted passage through a nearby tree by Hevestro to the city of Jrusar after Scrying on and discovering that the allies that you seek currently reside within the Spire by Fire tavern . As the gateway is opened within the tree, your new friend Prism enlarges her raven ally and grasps it, and glides outward.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nHanging onto Mother like a hang glider, Prism sails through the portal and off a cliff in Jrusar, but Orym manages to use Seedling 's Grasping Vines to pull her to safety. They realize they've arrived on the posh Lucent Spire , and talk a bit about what to do now. Laudna suggests the local Starpoint Conservatory to Prism, who plans to pose as a high mage of the Cobalt Soul . While coming through the tree, she realized how to cast Teleportation Circle , so they'll be able to keep in touch.\n\nThey head toward the gondola, which is working, but the passersby are nervous and hurrying. A fellow passenger, a courier, tells them that the Apogee Solstice started as a celebration, but that changed as it continued. The Chandei Quorum has announced it's made some alliances due to the strange events around Ruidus and the Hellcatch Valley , and increased security. The party also tries to suggest more places Prism might try to gain information, including the Ascension's Rise university and the Prakash Pyre within the Temple of the Dawnfather . She invites them all to visit the Shadow Realm on the Matron's festival of the Night of Ascension.\n\n![Bells Hells reunited by Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/9a/Bells_Hells_reunited_by_Melissa_Hahn.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230707171651)\n\nThe group reaches the Spire by Fire and Imogen spots them as they enter. Laudna runs over and hugs her while Orym runs over and hugs Fearne . Introductions all around, with brief summaries of their experiences. Fearne cheerfully announces they had a threesome, and Prism talks about Bor'Dor 's betrayal. They decide to go upstairs to their rented room for more privacy.\n\nOnce there, they all share more details about their respective adventures and new abilities. Team Wildemount is horrified to hear Team Issylra killed an angel but accept the explanation that the church of the Dawnfather was being oppressive in the village. They also share that Bor'Dor belonged to the Ruby Vanguard . Fearne's excited that Orym met Dariax 's Deni$e . For the other team, FCG sums up that they saved Santa , met a king and queen , Deanna killed a goat, they had a lot of sexual escapades, and FCG met the Changebringer . They introduce FRIDA , who plays back Imogen's voice describing Laudna as beautiful, embarrassing Imogen hideously.\n\n![Deanna worth saving - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/87/Deanna_worth_saving_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230712215339)\n\nMeanwhile, Deanna is upset by some of Prism's comments about the Dawnfather , and goes somewhere private to cast Commune . She asks if working with Bells Hells will save the gods, but the Dawnfather doesn't know the answer. She then asks if his disciples are perpetuating harm in the world at his behest. He responds that they are doing what is necessary for the good of \"our people\" collectively, and the future of Exandria. Her final question: Are you worth saving? She is forcefully thrust out of the communion and rejoins the others.\n\nAs they all continue discussing, Prism shares that there were 23 known ley line nexuses in Exandria before the solstice, and therefore potentially a lot of attempted power grabbing. The notes of Ludinus Da'leth indicated that the gods wanted people not to understand the nature of Ruidus , and to forget the entity imprisoned there. FCG interprets this as the gods trying to protect mortals. Team Issylra reveals they found an extraterrestrial githzerai in a crater, but when Ashton goes to show them the ring the creature was wearing, they discover Fearne has neatly pickpocketed it. She immediately gives it back and Ashton says they now owe her a beer. When Team Wildemount is telling about their teleportation mishap and meeting with the birdfolk, Prism sends Mother to sit on FCG's shoulder. He freaks out, which upsets Mother as well, and she poops on him. Eventually he tries to Banish the bird, but Prism Counterspells him.\n\nImogen points out they need to talk about what their plans are now. It seems clear they need to go back to the Malleus Key in the Hellcatch Valley , even though last time they weren't able to accomplish much. Chetney suggests going to see Ajit Dayal . Orym asks Deanna to try Scrying on his home, and gives her the remnants of the Message Bloom seed. Chetney creates an image of Keyleth , and the spell succeeds despite the apparent reluctance of the Dawnfather to aid Deanna. Keyleth is alive but badly injured. She is in her chambers in Zephrah , looking out a window, leaning heavily on her staff, and almost falls before the others in the room catch her and lead her back to bed. She still bears the wounds she received in the battle with Ludinus, and they are not healing. She stands again, moving to a thin tapestry and stroking the single long black feather tied at its end.\n\nOrym is distressed by this news, although the others tell him this means someone was able to get there and help her. Laudna suggests the druids may be able to help them with information about the elemental powers involved. FRIDA asks Imogen if it's possible her power derives from Predathos , and she agrees that's quite possible. FRIDA suggests that possibly they can put the Malleus Key back together and use it to re-imprison or destroy Predathos, rather than releasing him. Orym suggests Deanna, Prism, and FRIDA do research at the libraries both here and in Vasselheim while the rest of them travel to the Tishtan excavation site and the Malleus Key there.\n\nFCG wants FRIDA to stay with him, but FRIDA tells him telepathically that they don't trust Prism, and that's why FRIDA thinks they should go to protect Deanna. FCG is unhappy, and FRIDA confirms his suggestion it will be a short separation, but FRIDA does not truly believe that. FCG wants to go with them, but Deanna quietly asks who will heal his group if he does. After much thought, FCG says he doesn't need to flip a coin to make this decision, because he knows what the Changebringer would tell him. FCG's whole purpose is to help people, and a god can help so many more people than one person could. He will come with Bells Hells to try to preserve the Changebringer. But he confronts Prism with his suspicions of her motives, and she confesses she's just terribly confused . FCG admits he doesn't trust her, and she makes a deal with him, promising to bring FRIDA back to him if he'll promise to bring her new best friend Orym back to her alive. They really bonded, although she might be confusing battle mechanics with friendship. Laudna interjects that she thought killing Bor'Dor together bonded them in their trauma, but Prism thinks it's been really obvious that she and Orym really hit it off. To seal the deal, she gives FCG a cigarette although he doesn't breathe.\n\nFRIDA telepathically thanks Chetney for showing him it's important to stay hungry, and if FRIDA \"gets a little furry\", they'll find him. Imogen gives Laudna the corset they got her in Uthodurn, and Prism gives her some hair for Scrying purposes. Emotional goodbyes are said and Prism summons a Phantom Steed for the others in the shape of a giant bird. FRIDA kisses FCG, telling him, \"In hundreds of years I've never had this opportunity. I love you, Faithful Care-Giver. I'll see you soon.\" FCG responds, \"You will. That's a promise. I love you, FRIDA. Thank you for everything and for giving me yourself.\" As Prism says goodbye, she casts Enlarge on Orym making him temporarily 6'6\". While walking off, Deanna covers every symbol of the Dawnfather on her clothing with yarn.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e64-reunited"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E67-Bloody Flowers","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo last we left off, Bells Hells reuniting, being scattered across Exandria and a slight burst in time, managed to reconvene, catch up a little bit, and decide a number of various paths that should be set upon in the near future. The initial one, upon realizing how wounded Keyleth is and not recovering, to check in with her in Zephrah . In doing so, there was another reuniting with some of your home and family and people you haven't seen since you embarked on this journey with Bells Hells, really having the opportunity to catch up a bit with the people that are closest to you aside from those that you travel alongside.\n\nYou also discovered that Keyleth, the wounds not healing, does have one possible opportunity to salvage and recover from this. However, it sends you to one of many possible cursed areas, the most viable and proven one being the Grey Valley of Tal'Dorei . You also heard that there was a troop that already volunteered to go but a day before and has not returned, which was worrying. However, you were then sent to the Grey Valley, wandered about the dark and long-cursed and dangerously ominous landscape, avoiding being found and seen for much of it before encountering a number of terrifying fiendish entities. You did battle, and through some quick thinking and some powerful druidic magic managed to come out of there fairly well. Took a break, gathered yourselves, and prepared for the rest of your journey to gather enough of the perennem flowers to be utilized in healing Keyleth's wounds and setting forth on the next leg of your journey.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nFCG checks in with Orym : How's he doing after finding the dead and possessed Ashari , and his sister Baernie among the still-missing? Orym deflects, asking how everyone else is doing. Fearne is really good! Orym admits he's been better, that seeing Keyleth brought low has been very difficult. FCG notes that Laudna seems to be glowing a bit, and Laudna says that she and Imogen had a chance to discuss their feelings about the disparity between their experiences while separated, and extends an apology to everyone else for her earlier emotional outburst. The kiss between Imogen and her is not mentioned.\n\n![Voting about the gods by Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/3a/Voting_about_the_gods_by_Melissa_Hahn.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230804202719)\n\nThey discuss what to do next. Orym wants to go back to the Malleus Key . Imogen notes that they all seem to have different opinions about the gods, and although Predathos is clearly bad she's worried that ending Predathos may end her abilities as well, or end those who \"got their life from a godly power.\" But a lot of people depend on the gods so obviously the party supports the gods, right? FCG is not so sure the party actually does support them, and a straw poll reveals he's the only one actually in favor, with everyone else undecided except Ashton who abstains from being undecided. He retells his backstory of being raised in the Hishari cult and teleported to Marquet during the ceremony that destroyed them and killed his parents. Imogen reiterates that Predathos is bad, but Laudna and Chetney aren't sure that's true. Ashton is sure that Ludinus Da'leth , at least, needs to be taken care of, while Orym is certain that Predathos is indeed bad since he orchestrated the attack on Keyleth. Fearne is worried about what happens to Imogen if Predathos dies. Ashton says they need more information and should just keep looking for flowers for now.\n\n![Angry Fearne by Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f7/Angry_Fearne_by_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20230810223139)\n\nMoving onward, they notice faint glowing wisps moving through the trees, the ghosts of long-dead warriors. Chetney catches a smell like burning meat and Laudna sends Pâté out scouting but he sees very little. As they continue moving forward, they reach a huge hill sundered by a crevasse and the smell grows stronger. They notice a building in the cliffside, but when Fearne tries to get a closer look, she notices the spyglass she stole from Captain Xandis weeks earlier is missing. [1] Orym finally admits he gave it back to Xandis, and Fearne says she forgives him, but when he asks for Guidance to find more flowers, she only pretends to cast the spell on him. In the absence of any obvious perennem flowers , they decide to investigate the structures and attempt (badly) to stealth in that direction. Winged shapes guard the area, and two of them notice the party and start circling.\n\nChetney half-transforms into wolf-form, while FCG casts Spirit Guardians in the form of sheets of glass. One of the vrocks immediately takes radiant damage from it while attempting to attack. Imogen Catapults a rock into the vrock, but it screeches and stuns her, and Orym immediately uses Bait and Switch to trade spots with her and boost her AC. Ashton rages and slams into the creature, knocking it 25 feet away where Chetney grapples it. The other vrock attacks him, but Laudna's Silvery Barbs saves him from a crit. She immediately Eldritch Blasts the creature, killing it. Turning to the one Chetney has grappled, Fearne casts Burning Hands hitting both Chetney and the vrock. It screeches one more time, stunning Fearne and FCG, before Imogen finishes it with a Shocking Grasp .\n\nThe party quickly scuttles off toward the structure in the chasm, looking up at more vrocks circling overhead. They can now see the building is a small fort that appears very recently damaged and deserted. They recognize it as the Iridon Bastion , built not too many years ago as an extension of a temple to the Platinum Dragon and an early warning system against abyssal incursions. Chetney has a vision of it being overrun by demons only a few days earlier. As they approach, they split the party; Orym, Imogen, Ashton, and Laudna approach from above, while Pàté, Chetney, Fearne, and FCG stay on the chasm floor.\n\n![Teven Klask by Odd](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f3/Teven_Klask_by_Odd.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230805151839)\n\nFrom above, Orym sees the aftermath and destruction of a recent battle. There are multiple impish demons, three tall demon warriors, several small demons drawing glowing runic infernal circles, and three metal cages holding humanoids. A 13-foot tall corpulent dark furred demon with tiny wings glides down holding a beautiful silver sword that appears too small for it. FCG casts Tongues and hears it say, \"Hurry, I must feast soon. Prepare, then celebrate.\" Through Pàté, FCG tells the upper level team that they need to hurry. Fearne spots a demon wander near the structure and apparently be pulled into it and killed in a flare of fire. A horned and winged humanoid with deep red skin and gray hair emerges and Fearne assumes he could be a potential ally, telling the other team about him. They all decide they need to act now, so they prepare for battle, then Fearne starts calling for help while Chetney pretends to attack her. All the demons turn toward them.\n\nImogen immediately hits the tower (avoiding the cage there) with Synaptic Static , killing the smaller demons and confusing the larger one. The other demons begin moving toward Fearne and Chetney. The topside team jumps off the cliff, Laudna casting Feather Fall as they go. Orym uses Seedling 's Grasping Vines to pull him to land silently next to the cage on the tower, joined by Imogen and Laudna, and Ashton uses the immovable rod now implanted in his hammer to halt his descent just above the tower and leap onto it. Meanwhile, FCG Commands the two demons investigating the disturbance to \"Mime\". Chetney stays with them while the others run to try climb up to the fortress, but the hillside is too steep. The Command wears off and the demons pick up their blades and rush to attack.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nOn the tower, inside the cage are a female soldier of the Platinum Dragon and a Tempest Blade gnome . Orym attacks the demon just below them while Laudna (in her Form of Dread) successfully picks the lock on the cage. Fearne reaches the potential devilish ally and persuades him that she is, if not yet his friend, at least not an enemy. FCG casts Scramble the Dead (a reskinned Toll the Dead ) on a demon, while Imogen casts Minute Meteors . On the devil's turn, he flies to the two demons and slashes one of them with a glowing sword and a Divine Smite , causing massive damage. Chetney uses Blood Curse of Bloated Agony and Turmoil to finish it off and damage the other. Ashton joins Orym and seriously wounds the demon facing him. However, the tiny-winged demon leader sends them a mental welcome to the feast, while telling his fellow demons that they taste better still wiggling. It then teleports on top of the cage Laudna and Imogen are next to. Another demon runs out of the fortress and joins the fight, and the one on Chetney hits with a sword and bite. The quasits begin scattering. One goes invisible and another tries to scare Orym, but fails.\n\nOrym slashes the demon in front of him, then jumps to Imogen and uses Bait and Switch to increase her AC by 8, while Laudna opens the cage door and takes refuge inside it. She uses a Ray of Frost that weakens the soldier prisoner's chains, injuring her but allowing her to break them. FCG Commands the demon near him to \"Betray\", which allows FCG to move past without being attacked. Imogen Lightning Bolts the nalfeshnee next to her but it does minimal damage. Meanwhile, their devil ally attacks for more massive damage on a demon and Chetney follows up with Turmoil, but the demon is still up. Ashton finishes off the demon on the tower. The demon leader on the cage tries a Horror Nimbus but no one is affected. All three of his subsequent attacks on Imogen hit, however, for 59 total damage. She is still up, barely. The demon near Chetney attacks the devil, but the Blood Curse damages him just enough to finish him off.\n\nOrym attacks the threatening nalfeshnee, trying to disarm it and finally succeeds, the sword falling to the courtyard far below. He uses his last Superiority Die to fling Imogen away with an added 9 to her AC, telling Laudna, \"Get her out of here!\" Laudna tries to hit and fails with two Shocking Grasps , then grabs Imogen and pulls her off the tower, using her Mirror Image to avoid the opportunity attack. They Feather Fall off the tower to safety where Imogen takes her Potion of Superior Healing, then shoots a Psychic Lance at the leader, catching his notice. Fearne casts Blight on one of the demons, but a vrock flies in and tries to attack Ashton. Chetney runs to the beautiful sword that the nalfeshnee dropped. Ashton tries to reach the big demon but the vrock gapples them, so Ashton attacks it instead, damaging it and knocking it back 5 feet, allowing him to reach the demon leader and whack him. The demon, however, leaps off the tower and lands next to Laudna and Imogen, clawing and biting Imogen and sending her unconscious.\n\n![Laudna protecting the fallen Imogen - Pyromeekorai](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nOrym sees this and jumps off the tower, taking the damage from the fall and landing on the leader, hitting him. Laudna also attacks with a Blight and tries to shield Imogen's unconscious body with her Form of Dread. Fearne wild shapes into a shoebill, picking up FCG and flying him toward Imogen, getting him close enough to cast Healing Word on Imogen and bring her back to consciousness. She grabs the demon's foot and casts Shocking Grasp , removing its reaction and then casting Invisibility on both Laudna and her, then runs toward FCG. Meanwhile, the devil finishes off another demon, and Chetney grabs the lost sword before attacking the demon leader and attempting to draw his attention, then running to another cage. He hears a voice push into his mind, saying, \"Rise in glory. Take what you've taken and together, we will do great things.\" Ashton jumps down and attacks the demon leader, doing serious damage and infuriating it. It teleports to the opposite side of the courtyard, fleeing, followed by the vrocks.\n\nThe invisible Laudna moves to another locked cage, telling FCG Imogen is injured and invisible. Fearne flies after the escaping demon leader, dropping her shoebill form to cast Blight for the How do you want to do this? . It dies, threatening to find and kill her. She takes its tusks. Laudna and Chetney succeed in opening the remaining cages and releasing all the prisoners: two Iridon Bastion soldiers (Uwon and Diedrich), two Tempest Blades (Jennis and Erana), and Baernie , Orym's sister-in-law. When Orym and Baernie see each other, they run and hug joyfully. Baernie knew someone would come rescue them, but didn't think it would be him.\n\n![Fearne and Teven by MidnightCrows](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe devil who aided them approaches Fearne, introducing himself as Teven Klask . He explains he is one of many champions of his patron, acting as a disruptor, assassin, and scout. He asks to whom she gives her fealty, and she responds, \"Myself\". He notes she is outside the \"Knotted Weave\", and tells her he kneels to Asmodeus . Something is brewing in Exandria that has shaken the Lord of the Hells, and Teven has been sent with instructions that under the circumstances and for the moment, he can deal with worshippers of the Prime Deities . Teven mentions to Fearne that there are many gifts that can be granted on certain paths, if she chooses to follow Asmodeus. She asks what that entails, and he replies, \"An eternity of purpose, strength, and pleasures for those who fall under his shadow.\" He had her at \"pleasures\". Fearne is fascinated, and he takes her hand and kisses it. Left behind is a small mark of a black horned crown. Teven tells her the path is open, and all she needs to do is ask for Asmodeus' aid. Fearne accepts, taking his hand. He closes it with his own, and says, \"The pact is sealed,\" promising they'll meet again. Flying upward, he tells Imogen, \"I think our destinies are entwined,\" before disappearing in a gust of flame.\n\nOrym asks Baernie what happened to them. Unfortunately, they were unaware the Bastion had been attacked and fallen, and when they approached some of their group were slain, some fled, and some captured for use in a demon feast to celebrate the victory. The nalfeshnee leader called himself Extovass the Gluttonous , who knelt to a prince named Vrudauliun . The Ashari find two of their backpacks, holding enough flowers to cure Keyleth . Chetney asks if the sword he found belonged to any of them, but they only look confused. FCG offers to Identify it but Chetney tucks it in the Bag of Holding . [2] Imogen can Teleport in the morning, but they move off before making camp for the night to a place of greater safety, where Baernie casts Stone Shape to create a small hidden cavern. Tired but successful, they rest for the night.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e67-bloody_flowers"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E63-A Haunted Past","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nOur troop of scallywags that have found themselves together after finding themselves shunted across the world and lost on the continent of Issylra , have come together as a troop out of survival necessity, have traversed elements of the mysterious land, and recently were guided northward to the Shrine of the Emerald Tree. Upon searching for the individual who has been watching over the shrine, Hevestro , apparently an individual who would give you the option or the ability to return to where you wish to go, where you once came from, you began to delve into the shattered interior of the shrine, finding signs of life at some point, furniture and homey alcoves with decor and signs of hosting, but no people. Upon pushing deeper and deeper within, you found a larger crystalline chamber. Within this space, as the central rock mountain that consumes the far back wall of the interior rises up, you can see the green emerald stone-like pillar that sits up above, glowing with a shadowed interior. As you all began to look about, you could see signs of recently abandoned rituals. You could see remnants of magical incantations that have been abandoned. And within that space, as you're all glancing around, you, Orym , looked up, and amongst the ceiling shadow, saw a face that looked back at you and then smiled.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nOrym alerts the others to the face among the crystals in the ceiling, and as the air chills around them it snarls that they are intruders in its domain. Bor'Dor tells it that Abaddina sent them in search of Hevestro , but the response is that Hevestro \"is not available\". Its name is Evithorir , and both Hevestro and Oma-Dua are \"mine\" and \"in me\". The valley belongs to it, from long ago. Prism senses fey energy from the creature and attempts to convince it they only want to utilize whatever magics may be held within the cavern, but Evithorir responds they smell of potential. Whatever is happening outside the valley has freed it and it is home. They offer help, but it responds that the only way they can help is to join Hevestro. Roll initiative!\n\nAshton begins a Gravity rage and notices two red glowing orbs which can be apparated by the creature, and which each drain the color from the area around them. The party discovers Evithorir is resistant to non-magical attacks and lightning damage, and has legendary resistances and attacks. It casts a Circle of Death , hitting the entire party for significant damage. When he stabs Evithorir, Orym notices a person held deep within the creature's shadowy form which is briefly revealed whenever the creature is damaged. The party is able to begin damaging the shadow entity, although Bor'Dor is seriously damaged and uses his turn to cast Cure Wounds on himself. Prism Counterspells the creature's attempted Cloudkill against the party. Laudna retreats but vines close in and block the exit from the cave. Ashton fails his save against the entity's Frightening Gaze and is frightened.\n\n![Prism moves the body - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/f3/Prism_moves_the_body_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230625222400)\n\nUnable to approach Evithorir, Ashton attacks and shatters one of the red orbs. The entity, however, uses a Shadow Spear to pin Orym to the wall behind him, restraining him there. Orym uses Seedling 's distance attack to hit Evithorir from where he's held, hitting for significant damage, then uses the sword's Grasping Vines to pull the shadowy humanoid figure from within the creature where it falls at Orym's feet. Prism Dimension Doors the body, which they assume is Hevestro , away from the creature and near a startled Ashton. The shadow figure pursues and readies a Fireball , but it is Counterspelled by Laudna, who is counter- Counterspelled by Evithorir, who is counter-counter- Counterspelled by Prism. On her turn, Laudna attacks first with Eldritch Blasts and then with Chilled Touch , preventing Evithorir from recovering hit points, but the creature continues to move toward the unconscious Hevestro, trying to wrap him in its shadows and drag him closer.\n\nAshton picks up Hevestro and runs toward the others. Deni$e meets him and feeds Hevestro a healing potion , bringing him back to consciousness but very confused. Orym moves to him as well, using Bait and Switch to protect the archdruid while the others continuing attacking. Bor'Dor shoots a Lightning Bolt through both one of the orbs and a crystal, seriously wounding Evithorir. When the shadow creature casts another Fireball , however, it knocks Hevestro out once again and severely damages Prism, Orym, and Deni$e. Using a quickened spell, Laudna fires multiple Eldritch Blasts at the creature, finishing him off and causing him to shrink into an evaporating black blob that Laudna picks up with her blackened hand and squishes.\n\nBor'Dor heals Hevestro to consciousness again with a Mass Cure Wounds on everyone but Laudna, and Hevestro explains that he is the guardian of this shrine of Oma-Dua , an ancient Gau Drashari who became the protector of the area centuries ago by bonding with an eidolon spirit and becoming one with the land. Long ago, Oma-Dua battled Evithorir the Taker and sealed it away beneath the rock of Cofferfall Hill to the west. The magic of the Apogee Solstice somehow allowed Evithorir to escape, and he made his way back to the cavern where he slaughtered the inhabitants and captured Hevestro in eternal shadow.\n\nAshton catches the reference to the Gau Drashari and questions Hevestro about it, and is assured he did not say \" Hishari \". Oma-Dua is now known as \" The Emerald Tree\" , the large central green crystal within the cavern. Although he is not familiar with the term \" residuum \", the crystal is indeed powerful in ritual and enchantment. Laudna follows up about Hevestro's apparent distaste for the Hishari, and is told about the takeover of the humble village of Tumilo 50 years ago by a charismatic cult leader named Efterin , who renamed it \"Hishari\" as a tribute to both the Gau Drashari and the Ashari (to their apparent displeasure). He preached reverence for the older elemental spirits and the need to restore the Primordial powers. The town was eventually destroyed, likely by their attempt to control powers they did not understand. Joan Abaddina was a member who survived this destruction, saw the error of their teachings, and came to train under Hevestro before returning to Hearthdell .\n\nOrym brings up the reason for their visit: they need to be able to travel across the oceans. Hevestro asks they first tell him what has happened while he was unconscious, and Laudna uses Silent Image to show him the location of the Malleus Key in Marquet and the tethered Ruidus .\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nHevestro believes that the Apogee Solstice enduring so long indicates that some things have changed permanently. He needs a night's rest before attempting to return them to their homes, and invites them to spend the night. While they watch, he bundles up the remains of three of his compatriots who were apparently killed in the attack, carrying them outside for burial.\n\nStill in the cavern shrine, the party begins settling for the night. Deni$e unexpectedly grabs Bor'Dor 's arm, twisting it behind his back, and tells him it feels like he's not telling them everything. Bor'Dor tries and fails to break free, asserting he's told them everything he needs to tell, but Deni$e persists until Bor'Dor admits he doesn't have a dying brother. He was scared and trying to get their sympathy. He didn't recognize the places they Scryed on. He's not a sheep herder; he's a leather worker. He eventually stands and tells them he'll tell them the truth.\n\n![Bor'Dor's revelation by ElesirArt](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/e/e0/Bor%27Dor%27s_revelation_by_ElesirArt.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230630171125)\n\nHe grew up on the Menagerie Coast , not far from Port Damali . His mother's name was Livandra , and she was blessed by the Wildmother , secretly teaching Bor'Dor her ways while posing as leatherworkers. Eventually, Bor'Dor got into a fight with some townsfolk and used his powers to Inflict Wounds on them. His mother took the blame and the punishment, relying on the gods to protect her, but Bor'Dor's father and brother fought unsuccessfully to free her, destroying Livandra's faith in the gods in the process. She gave Bor'Dor her dagger and told him to run before casting a Vitriolic Sphere on herself and the guards surrounding her. He fled to the Cyrios Mountains and used his magic to survive, eventually developing a reputation as a magic user. He was approached by those more powerful and connected, and asked simply if he believed in the gods and if what they did was good, and when he replied he did not, he found a community. When Deni$e asks what community, Bor'Dor's drops a disguise spell, changing his appearance from innocent to worn, experienced, and sad with the experience of great loss. He fires a Vitriolic Sphere into his small crystal he left on the ground, splitting the spell and hitting the entire party. Prism falls unconscious.\n\n![The death of Bor'Dor - Silesianna](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/5b/The_death_of_Bor%27Dor_-_Silesianna.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20230626124540)\n\nBor'Dor screams out that he saw them kill his friends in Marquet and they realize he was one of the Ruby Vanguard present at the activation of the Malleus Key at the Tishtan excavation site . Orym grabs Prism and pulls her away while feeding her a healing potion to bring her to consciousness before using Bait and Switch to raise her Armor Class, then shielding her. Ashton tosses her another potion as he attacks Bor'Dor, hitting him twice and knocking him prone. Deni$e grapples him, while Laudna Counterspells his attempt to Polymorph . Prone and grappled, Bor'Dor tells her to just get it over with and end it. She assumes her Form of Dread, but there is a faint purplish light in her eyes that hasn't been present for a while. She walks to Bor'Dor, shaking, and tells him, \"I'm really sorry, Bor'Dor. I just can't stand having anyone else betray me,\" as she takes his throat and casts Hunger of the Shadow , knocking him unconscious. In the back of her mind, Laudna begins hearing a slow heartbeat.\n\nDeni$e urges keeping him alive to question, and Prism listens, but the acid continues burning her and Bor'Dor's betrayal of her belief in his friendship burns even worse and she is furious. She hits him with her fist, inflicting two failed death saves. Laudna's Form of Dread is shifting ever so slightly, with a suggestion of the mourning veil of her original Form poking through. Deni$e continues to urge keeping him alive, and Ashton gently walks Prism away as Orym watches, completely silently. It is now up to Laudna, and she is struggling, but looks up to see Orym, watching, nod slightly. All the deaths she has seen run through her mind, with the sense of how out of her control things have been. In this moment, she has control. She casts Wither and Bloom , giving in to the darkness, using her last necrotic energy to suck the life force from Bor'Dor.\n\nAshton stands next to her as she instinctively lashes out, then dissolves in tears. He tells her it will be okay, and gently leads her off where he continues to comfort her. Orym lingers by the body, then pulls out the locket he took in respect from one of the slain Ruby Vanguard at the Malleus Key before tossing it onto the body, saying, \"We're at war.\"\n\n![Bor'Dor - Odd](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nIn the most respectful way possible, Deni$e begins looting the body. She buries the ashes, and puts a rock on top of the hole, then goes to comfort Prism, who is still feeling horribly betrayed and gullible. Hevestro returns and comforts the group, urging them to rest, and Prism apologizes to Laudna for losing her temper, but urges her not to be too hard on herself. Laudna is deeply afraid her loss of control in exchange for a brief moment of empowerment will allow Delilah Briarwood to return.\n\nIn the morning, Prism tells Ashton and Dynios she doesn't want to go back to the Cobalt Soul , and proposes that she and Dynios abscond in search of more books and knowledge. Dynios agrees, and she asks Ashton to egg her on to do it. Ashton tells her it's not a good way to run from herself, but she's a criminal nerd and he thinks it's a good idea. He suggests Whitestone , where the lord is a total dick and stealing from him would be amazing, while Deni$e suggests Kymal .\n\nDeni$e asks Prism to Scry on Dariax , and she finds him in a tavern she recognizes as likely being in Westruun . Orym uses his sending stone , trying to contact Dorian , but the Sending fails. Deni$e suddenly remembers she stole one of the \"Wanted\" posters for the Crown Keepers in Tal'Dorei and shows it to Orym, who is slightly horrified he's still wanted by the mob there. It shows all of the Crown Keepers, and Orym asks if he can keep it. Deni$e hugs everyone and says goodbye, and they walk to a nearby tree where Hevestro opens a portal and she runs through.\n\nPrism Scrys again, using the ring Imogen gave Laudna, and they see the city of Jrusar , the missing members of their party gathered around a tavern table. They invite Prism to come with them, and they each give her some hair (an amethyst from Ashton) so she'll be able to contact them in the future, but at the last minute, she decides to go with them. Hevestro opens a new portal to Jrusar and they all run through, the portal closing behind them. Hevestro nods, and some leaves tumble into his outstretched hand. \"Everything's changing.\" And he turns and walks away.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e63-a_haunted_past"}

You uncovered a strange damaged contraption that seems to be tied to the history and the longevity and innate power of Ludinus, and upon acquiring a few friendly tinkerers, some you saved as well, set that device on the path to being repaired and possibly bent to your use. Along this journey also, Ashton discovered a little bit about his essence, his past, the Hishari people which he was once with and is one of the sole survivors of, and what seems to be the essence of one of the ancient long-destroyed primordial titans that is buried and entwined with his physical essence, a powerful dormant power that lies within. Upon seeking any sort of interesting information on this, you gathered that one entity, Evontra'vir , the Great Tree of Atrophy that exists in the Shattered Teeth , was responsible for passing the shard of power that created this incident of the Hishari on to the leader of that cult .\n\nWith that lead, you made your way to the Shattered Teeth, made friends with an older tortoise woman who had helped Keyleth through her grief many years ago, who led you on the path to the island of Kalutha . You decided the best route to take to get there involved summoning a ghost ship and parlaying with its captain . After a seemingly unbeatable continuation of undead ghost skeletons assaulting you, however, you sent them fleeing and made a deal with Captain Novos that included giving over to him the intelligent legendary weapon that [ Chetney ] had been keeping at [his] side. This deal was accepted, and as such bought you passage across the seas to the island of your destination, where you currently now sit upon the oddly creaking ghost ship that floats, billowing out mist and fog across the waves, heading in a southeast direction for the next two to three days.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Ashton getting his tattoo - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1d/Ashton_getting_his_tattoo_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230928145841)\n\nFresh Cut Grass attempts to Scry on Caleb Widogast , while Fearne tries for Beauregard Lionett , but they both hit an immediate block and the attempts fail. FCG then Scrys on D but sees nothing that can identify his location beyond the Menagerie Coast . Laudna asks if FCG can Scry on Delilah Briarwood , but he's out of spell slots for now. Ashton proposes they all get matching tattoos from Vendallo , one of the crew members, and they agree on a flaming bell. Over the next few days of the voyage, they all receive a tattoo.\n\nLaudna admits to the others that Delilah is back in her head, and that it was her casting of Hunger of the Shadow to kill Bor'Dor Dog'Son that caused it. FCG and Laudna believe she might embrace the shadow to gain strength in their coming battles, and Kyle, a crewmember, suggests it's like dealing with an addiction: you learn to deal with the impulses and rely on those around you to resist giving into it. The party decides to make a nametag for Kyle since the crew is always forgetting his name. The next day, FCG tries Scrying on Delilah, but the spell unravels immediately. They decide to try Shared Dream instead, and Imogen casts Detect Thoughts simultaneously, while Laudna meditates on Delilah but has trouble remembering her face and FCG has trouble focusing as well.\n\nFearne finds the captain's quarters below but fails her lockpicking attempt. The Captain finds her there and she tells him she's just looking for a comfortable place to sleep. He buys this story and tells her to come back that night. When she goes back on deck, she is confronted by Cyrillia , the navigator, who warns her not to sleep with the captain.\n\n![Fearne and the captain by Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/ca/Fearne_and_the_captain_by_Pyromeekorai.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230926085720)\n\nThe final evening of the journey, the captain tells Fearne that if she wants to rest, now is the time. He escorts her to his cabin and unlocks the door. Inside, she asks again about the crew's curse, which condemns them to pursue the captain's former items, finding those who wronged them, and ending their bloodlines. Fearne lays down in the bed, but in a few moments, the Captain approaches and says, \"You're very warm.\" He asks if she is offering some of her warmth, and after some hesitation she agrees, but she asks for Graz'tchar 's return and when he refuses, asks if she can just say goodbye to it. He allows her to hold it in exchange for some of her warmth. The sword addresses Fearne, trying to recruit her, but when she asks the captain, he denies the sword ever spoke to him. Reluctantly, Fearne hands it back and invites him into the bed. She teaches the captain how to \"spoon\", curling around him for a few hours while he rests and she looks around the cabin. Then, she feels her body temperature drop and voluntarily relinquishes the warmth she promised the Captain. ( Ashley loses 5 HPs permanently and Matt will reveal a second consequence to her at the break.)\n\n![Cyrillia and Fearne by Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/7f/Cyrillia_and_Fearne_by_Elaine_Tipping.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20231002130502)\n\nBack on deck, Orym notices that Cyrillia constantly shadows the Captain very closely. When he and Fearne disappeared below, Cyrillia seemed to climb over the edge of the ship and disappear. While she's occupied, Orym climbs the crow's nest and steals the spyglass there. When Fearne returns to the upper deck, she notices Cyrillia standing next to her, radiating heat from her permanently smoldering skeleton. Cyrillia asks what they were doing, and warns her not to ever touch the captain. She is furious to hear Fearne gave him warmth. Fearne apologizes, telling her the captain only talked about Cyrillia and that he's just waiting for Cyrillia to approach him.\n\nIn the morning, when Fearne awakens, the captain is sitting nearby. He asks for more of her warmth but she's reluctant, saying she'd need something in exchange. Cyrillia has overheard, and Fearne tells her that now is her chance. Imogen telepathically reminds her that her formerly fire genasi body is warm, but Cyrillia is still furious. Fearne convinces her to try, giving her a pep talk, and as the rest of the crew watches, Cyrillia knocks on the cabin door. When the captain opens it, expecting Fearne, Cyrillia ignites flames onto his chest, telling him it's time they stop dancing around, and make a fire. She pushes him into the cabin and the door closes behind them.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Imogen and Laudna dancing by Nev @ammarilyo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe crew is gathered around the captain's cabin door watching steam rise from underneath it. Laudna sends Pâté invisibly to look in the window but the steam blocks the view. They notice, however, the lanterns' light seems warmer, and when Cyrillia emerges, her bones are no longer burning as fiercely. Laudna proposes throwing a party for the pirates on the morning of their final day and they send the pirates below while they plan, prepare, and decorate. Fearne and FCG provide music, lights by Imogen , drugged brownies by FCG, and limbo by Orym . They present Kyle the nametag Chetney has crafted for him and he wears it proudly. Cyrillia and the captain are giving each other fond glances when Cyrillia notices her spyglass is missing. Her preoccupation with Urlu, however, draws her attention away. One of the pirates plays the fiddle and the ghost skeletons begin dancing as Orym starts a break-dancing class and Chetney does caricatures of the crew.\n\nWhen they approach land, the Captain stops the party and threatens Bells Hells that if they ever reveal any of this, their bloodlines will be obliterated. They promise to tell everyone how scary and horrifying their journey was, and the captain then jovially bids them farewell, thanks them, gives them a list of some of his missing items to keep an eye out for, and tells them to swim to shore.\n\nThey find themselves in a deserted lagoon on the island of Kalutha , the ship gone by the time they reach land. There are basalt cliffs surrounding the beach with two openings leading within them like natural lava tubes, and Ashton gets a sense there is something familiar about the area (although he has never been there) and feels oddly compelled. Laudna sends Pâté to scout and he discovers the upper cave, through a fork on the left, leads through to the top of the cliff and the rest of the mist-covered, alien-landscaped island. They find one abandoned encampment on the beach, and another in the lower of the two caverns.\n\nThe upper cave is about 40 feet up. Imogen climbs ten feet, then Misty Steps the rest of the way up and drops a rope for the rest, but the mist makes it slick to climb and Ashton and Orym both suffer exhaustion from the attempt. They cautiously enter the cavern, knowing that the left branch leads up and out. Chetney decides to explore the right branch, catching a sweet citrusy scent that seems slightly putrescent, and hears a slithering sound. Something large slithers past, a huge two-headed worm-like creature (a basalt caecilian ) that begins encircling him. Chetney quietly takes out and blows the Horn of Silent Alarm , targeting Imogen, and she alerts the others. They all rush to join him, Laudna using Spider Climb to skitter along the walls, as Chetney assumes his hybrid form.\n\nThey quickly discover that the acidic nature of the creature causes those in melee with it to take acid damage when it is wounded. It also inflicts serious damage with its bites, and can extend its stomach out of its body for massive acid damage and loss of maximum hit points, plus pulling the target towards itself on a failed save, as well as slightly healing itself on its turn. Laudna uses Chill Touch twice during the battle to prevent it healing itself, while FCG uses Misty Step from the Staff of Dark Odyssey to escape from melee with the creature. The party takes significant damage from the creature's bites and stomach attacks, but continue to damage it. Eventually, Ashton gets the How do you want to do this?\n\nImogen berates Pâté for not noticing the creature when he scouted the cave while Ashton makes sure it's dead. Chetney finishes exploring the right-hand tunnel, finding a chasm where ocean water flows beneath the island. Imogen finds a number of broken weapons, an unusual longsword, one unbroken sword, and a set of armor. Orym recognizes the material they're made from: woe steel , created in the destruction of Domunas , and sacred to the Ossended Host . Imogen also finds a unique charm, which Orym identifies as a raito charm , part of the Aishio culture of Kalutha , but no one can read the script engraved upon it. The party takes a short rest to recover, and Chetney uses Grim Psychometry to learn the charm was owned by a person who was killed by the caecilian. The party decides they should try to return it to his relatives, and take the leftward path upward to daylight and the jungles of Kalutha, and the shadow of the three massive mountains that dominate the landscape.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e73-kindling_the_spirits"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E74-Roots Between Worlds","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells , in seeking answers surrounding Ashton 's history, and possible opportunities to prepare themselves better for the coming showdown with the Ruby Vanguard , you find yourselves in the Shattered Teeth , a collection of islands left in the destruction of the once-continent Domunas . Here, you've gone onto a ghost ship to find passage to the island of Kalutha . Upon taking this journey across the sea with them, you helped bring a long separate romance to a singular unit between the captain and their navigator , had a celebration, and then were dropped off rather rapidly on the outskirts of the island you seek.\n\nAs you perused the black pebble beaches, you found a couple of caverns, one that led up to the actual clifftop surface of the island itself for a better view. Upon clambering through the caverns, a sight was missed upon one of the creatures that apparently called it home, and you did battle with a terrifying massive worm creature that was intent on making you its next meal. Surviving the encounter, destroying the creature, and gathering a few odd objects from its nest that gave you some clues as to the denizens of this island, you clambered out to the surface, where you could see the mist-shrouded island stretched out before you.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Ashton overlooking Kalutha - SuzySnoo](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/d/dc/Ashton_overlooking_Kalutha_-_SuzySnoo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20231008120655)\n\nThe fog isn't quite as dense as it is at sea or on Slival , but still present, obscuring the three mountains that mark this island. They appear about two days' journey away. The party moves off through the insect-infested jungle, and with Eyes of the Runekeeper Laudna reads the mysterious writings on the raito charm they found in the lair of the basalt caecilian . They read: \"My promise to Shotas\", \"My love of my children, Ro and Sakagi\", \"My faith in the cycle of destruction and creation, endless\", and \"My guilt over my father, Gyodoba\". The name engraved at the top reads \"Iffodola\".\n\nThe party travels toward the mountains with Fresh Cut Grass flipping his Coin of the Changebringer to determine the correct path through the dense rainforest. They reach a small river and, holding Laudna's immovable rod , Orym leaps over the river with a rope while Chetney catches fish for dinner. Ashton suggests sending Pâté into the water to test its danger but nothing happens. Most of the party crosses safely, but Laudna tries tightroping across and falls in. Ashton jumps in after her while Orym sends vines toward them both, helping them pull to safety in front of a family of monstrous hippopotami. FCG casts Speak with Animals and tries to explain they mean them no harm, and although unimpressed, the beasts let them leave.\n\nThey follow the river without incident the rest of the day. When it grows darker, Fearne creates a shelter with Plant Growth and FCG bakes (badly) in his body the fish Chetney caught. It grows colder and Ashton and Chetney take first watch, seeing nothing, but Laudna takes nine points and Orym takes six points of necrotic damage. When Chetney enters their shelter, he notices movement and when he lights up his chisel, he sees about a dozen small, thin, elongated shadow shapes around them that recoil from the light. Imogen tries to connect with them but feels only a yearning to consume heat. Laudna hits one with Chill Touch and it dissipates, then FCG uses Turn Undead and scatters them. Chetney starts a small fire and during the rest of the night there are no more incursions, although the shadows surround them outside. They disappear at dawn.\n\nThe party continues traveling toward the mountains, with Fearne taking the lead, and Chetney plucks her a purple flower. At mid-afternoon, they approach the base of the nearest mountain and notice a trail forking away from the river. They follow the path until Orym notices a trap set before them and stops the group. After much discussion, Imogen throws a stone into it and sets it off, discovering a pike-filled pit beneath. As they cautiously move on, they notice many other traps along the way but evade them all, approaching a pool of water at the base of the mountain.\n\nThe trail begins to climb. FCG casts Find the Path using Ashton as his focus to find Evontra'vir , but it does not work. Orym notices five humanoid figures approaching surreptitiously and alerts the group, but the figures emerge from the forest and surround them, armed with heavy woe steel longbows and speaking in a foreign languages. FCG casts Tongues to hear them say, \"Put down your weapons,\" and they comply. Their leader, in Common, demands to know who they are and how they got here.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe five cloaked figures surround the party, and Imogen and Orym mention Iffodola, the name engraved on the raito charm they found. Orym pulls it out, offering it to their leader, who says it belonged to Temu's father and he will be happy to have it back in their family. Orym asks about Evontra'vir , and Ashton explains he has the blood of a titan and wants to learn more about himself. The strangers recognize Jirana 's name when FCG says she sent them, and tell them that Evontra'vir's presence between the realms of life and death is what draws the shadow creatures that attacked the party earlier. But they decline to give any further aid.\n\n![Methods of flying - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b9/Methods_of_flying_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231008115543)\n\nImogen casts Fly on herself to get above the forest canopy, but can't pick out a good direction until she brings Orym up with her. He sees the trees seem to thin out in near the mountain and when they fly closer, can see a chasm descending into darkness cradled between the three mountains. As darkness approaches, they reach the huge, ominous, extremely deep black expanse. They decide to write down their essential facts and convictions before descending, then leap together into the pit. When they eventually seem to see the bottom, Imogen casts Fly again, Fearne transforms into a shoebill, and Laudna casts Feather Fall on the others. The party falls into the canopy of the tree but eventually manages to find their ways to the ground, where there are multiple small offerings from previous visitors, and skulls.\n\nEventually, Ashton walks to it and touches its trunk, calling out to it, and identifying himself as \"Ashton, blood of titan\". He cuts himself, rubbing a bit of blood into the tree. The leaves rustle and the branches shift and a enormous stretched face appears within the tree trunk itself, asking, \"What is it you seek?\" Ashton says he is the abandoned child of the Hishari and seeks what is owed to him: his past, power, and to know what he is.\n\n“\nYou are the son of Efterin, a broken man of burning purpose, who endured an odyssey to walk under my boughs and ask for the golden purpose they felt they were owed by the world. He claimed visions throughout his life that promised greatness, a fated path that would leave his mark on history. He was not wrong. I let him gaze into his future and showed him the relic he was fated to own, that he would use to usher in a renewed ancient power. I showed him the way to the necropolis of Toramunda, where this relic lay uncovered and waiting. His ambition met his destiny, and he recovered his artifact, this remaining shard of Ka'Mort, the primordial Empress of Earth, a lingering remnant of her power. He thought his destiny was his to embrace. He was wrong. I granted him this knowledge because he was meant to take it, meant to create and destroy the Hishari, meant to destroy himself, meant to create you. You were his destiny, but in his arrogance he could not see beyond his own aspirations, as it was fated. And now, you return, as I have foreseen, to find another piece of history's sorrow, the unity that twice brought judgment to Exandria's children.\n”\n\n– \nEvontra'vir explaining Ashton's history and destiny.[1]\n[!h]\n\n\n\n\nEvontra'vir explains he was originally among those Gau Drashari who stewarded the protection of the ancient settlement of Toramunda during the division of Mount Ygora into the flying city of Avalir and the terrestrial Cathmoíra , before the catastrophic explosion that destroyed Domunas and created the Shattered Teeth at the beginning of the Calamity . Ashton pulls out the Pipe of Remembrance and Evontra'vir agrees to smoke it, revealing visions of hundreds of persons running, then caught, brought to the tree, and vanishing into it.\n\nEvontra'vir tells Ashton that a spark of Rau'shan burns in the heart of the Chynes Maw on the island of Igthuldus , in the side of Athos Peak , but warns them that if one vessel hold two of the shards of power, it might sunder it. Ashton holds the strength of The Empress ; they must find and bestow the might of The Emperor .\n\n![Evontra'vir - Niko Vanhala](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/46/Evontra%27vir_-_Niko_Vanhala.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20231010005017)\n\nThe tree looks to the others and asks why they have come. Chetney asks if Evontra'vir knows anything of the moons, and is told they are part of that tangle, all bound to this journey. Imogen asks how they can stop Predathos and is told that together, their chaos can undo the plans of others, and they can guide the future of the gods. The tree asks them to choose what they believe, and what is right for the world. He shows them a vision of the future, if Ludinus 's plan is not stopped, where the gods leave, chased by endless red light. But Evontra'vir cannot say what is right here-- they must choose. When Imogen asks how they can stop Ludinus, she is told they are already on that path, with visions of the Bloody Bridge , Ruidus , warfare, and the cavern where the shard of the Emperor is hidden. FCG asks how they will know when they are ready, and is told to look for allies. Ludinus should be stopped.\n\nSuddenly, the tree tells them they are being watched, and they see a small glowing orb appear and then shatter. Evontra'vir pulls itself open, revealing an open doorway into a snowy landscape and they dash through, finding themselves high up in the middle of a very cold and misty mountain range somewhere in the Shattered Teeth . Looking up at the mountain rising behind them, they notice one small area bare of snow and ice. They hear the low droning rumbling cry of a sky whale, and look up to see it vanishing into the clouds.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e74-roots_between_worlds"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E76-A Gathering of Heroes","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , in trying to gather answers to mysteries and possible power advantages in the coming conflict with the Ruby Vanguard and Ludinus Da'leth and his cronies, sought to look into the past of Ashton , as well as some unanswered questions that may lie within the Shattered Teeth . Traveling there, you befriended a ghost ship ,and helped bring romance together. You wandered through the dangerous misty jungles; you spoke to Evontra'vir , the Great Tree of Atrophy, and learned more about the titan blood that flows in your veins, and were sent to where a remaining shard of one of the great primordial titans still currently resided hidden and uncollected.\n\nThere, you delved through the very tight mountainous caverns beneath the mountain where it was held. You went to the lava pool and retrieved, both Ashton and Fearne together, within the depths of its molten rock, the last remaining spark of Rau'shan , and also seemed to draw the attention of Ludinus and some magically traveling associates. Battle ensued, in which you managed to free Fearne from what seemed to be a intended grasp at having a hostage. After defeating what seemed to be Ludinus, though eager to throw himself into the lava rather than give you information, and maybe not at the full power you expected, you took this fraction with you. Bruised but stalwart, you took the staff of Ludinus and decided to Teleport your troop to Whitestone , in hopes that the repaired harness from Ludinus' past might be the answer to unlocking the power of not one, but two primordial titan shards that are within your grasp.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Allura and Percival - Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/99/Allura_and_Percival_-_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20231023125837)\n\nThe first attempt to Teleport is a mishap and the party takes significant damage, but then land successfully at mid-morning at the Sun Tree in Whitestone . The Pale Guard rush up but had been told to expect them and escort them to the castle where they find Lord Percival de Rolo in his workshop with Imahara Joe , Dancer , and Verna the Viper . They have been working on the harness recovered from Ludinus Da'leth 's abandoned study in Molaesmyr . Lord Percival assures them the castle is warded against Scrying . An older Allura Vysoren enters, and there are introductions all around. The party briefly shares their most recent encounter with Ludinus and Allura believes the cracked opal they recovered from the simulacrum is what allowed the real Ludinus to learn from it. She has heard that he's been seen in many places recently.\n\nAllura approaches the harness, which appears much more vibrant than when they found it, although still inert. She begins magically marking in additional runes that alight, explaining it is a smaller version of a \"power still\" called a Quintessence Array, used to extract and refine arcane power from natural magical materials, or from living beings although that would be considered extremely amoral. She requests they turn it over to the Tal'Dorei Council or the Cobalt Soul once they have used it in the fight against the Ruby Vanguard .\n\nAshton shows Allura and the others the spark of Rau'shan . Allura has read about The Tree of Atrophy , and is impressed Ashton is infused with a shard of the Empress Ka'Mort . Laudna sees their purpose as primarily stopping Ludinus and saving the gods is simply a part of that (which Percival agrees with), while FCG points out the gods are worthy of being saved in their own right. Orym asks if they've heard from Keyleth , and is told she should be arriving shortly with some others, and there will be a meeting in the afternoon they should join.\n\nThey decide to test the harness by using it to suck the magic from a minor, unwanted magical item, and Chetney volunteers to be the recipient. Percival donates an enchanted set of dishes and they learn details of the properties of the harness, which permanently drains magic from an item or magical creature to grant the wearer hit points, an increase in abilities, or an unspecified unique benefit, depending on the object or creature drained. No one is sure what exactly draining the shard would do, but they warn of the danger of adding it to the power Ashton already carries. Laudna asks Ashton if the crystal in his head is actually his shard, and Allura inspects it, telling him it consists of dunamancy , a term new to them. She explains a bit about the Kryn Dynasty , the Luxon , and the Luxon beacons , telling them Ashton is something of a \"half-beacon\". The party remembers seeing a beacon as part of the Malleus Key , and Ashton points out one of the symbols on his old coat was a representation of a beacon, about which he's had dreams.\n\nThe party decides to take a short rest and eat before the afternoon meeting, but Laudna has Pâté go invisible and remain in the workroom with Percival and Allura. Dancer calls FCG aside and tells him she understands what he did wasn't him. FCG thanks her, telling her he hopes both of them find a path to purpose and happiness. He also asks about D , but she can tell him nothing that they didn't already know.\n\nMeanwhile, Pâté watches Percy tell Allura his concerns about making Whitestone a sanctuary, and the dangers that will bring. She responds that the world itself is in danger, but then notices the invisible Pâté, noting they're being eavesdropped on. Laudna directs Pâté to dance and be charming, but Allura throws him out. The group takes a short rest and eats while discussing their situation.\n\nEventually, a group of Pale Guard let them know Keyleth has arrived, and escort them to the War Room meeting. Present are Keyleth, Percival, Lady Allura, Professor Ebenold Kai of Grim Verity , and an older woman identified as Vilya , Keyleth's mother.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nProfessor Ebenold Kai tells the meeting that with Vilya 's aid, Grim Verity has been able to reach out and gain the support of leaders in Ank'Harel , Yios , and the Tangulan Keep in eastern Marquet , and of the Clovis Concord of the Menagerie Coast . Vilya has contacted allies in Wildemount , but the influence of the Ruby Vanguard is growing. The Arcana Pansophical has confirmed the disruption in communications is caused by the activation of the Malleus Key . The forces of Vasselheim currently surround that area, but the Ruidians have been able to defend it by use of their innate capabilities to diminish divine magic. The Pansophical also believes that there is a cumulative strain on the weave of magic and the leylines of Exandria that increases as the Key holds the peak of the Apogee Solstice in place.\n\nHowever, the red beam from the Key is also the only way to reach Ruidus , the moon itself. Bells Hells volunteers to scout the moon for the counterforces, based on their previous dreams and visions and the knowledge gained from them. Imogen shares the existence of cities and a population living there that feels bitter and entrapped, and also shares her sense of being drawn to join them. The party asks for items or other aid, and Allura tells them she can prevent them being Scryed on for eight hours. They can also aid in transport and in causing a distraction for the party. She will see what else may be available. When she asks if they understand and are willing to accept the risk involved, Laudna tells her most of them accept they might not come back. They've lived chaotic and tragic lives, but it's granted them purpose.\n\nAllura suggests Planerider Ryn would be extremely helpful, and Chetney shares that she was petrified and entrapped at the Malleus Key. Imogen asks about the two strangers from Wildemount ( Caleb Widogast and Beauregard Lionett ) they met at the key, and Allura recognizes their description. She's been in contact with some of their allies. Keyleth asks Vilya to hold their forces at the ready, and tells the group to prepare what they need for their scouting mission to the moon. Allura will do the same and offer what aid they can spare. FCG specifically requests a jeweled chalice worth 1000 gold (the component for a Heroes' Feast ), and Percival says he thinks that can be found. Multiple farewells are said among those present. As Keyleth leaves, Orym briefly stops her to thank her for her guidance so far, and Keyleth warns him to keep an eye on Imogen. She knows her mother works for the Ruby Vanguard. Orym, however, has complete faith in her.\n\n![Orym and Gwen - Laura Mackenzie@KiwiDrawer](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/be/Orym_and_Gwen_-_Laura_Mackenzie%40KiwiDrawer.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20231023182031)\n\nThe party talks about the possibility of Fearne contacting Teven Klask for help, and discusses what they want to accomplish while in Whitestone. Suddenly, Orym senses they're being watched and notices a small shadow down the hall. He finds Gwendolyn de Rolo lurking, and invites her to meet the others when she says she likes skeletons. Gwendolyn is fascinated by Laudna and by Pâté, and more so when Laudna carves open her own chest with a fingernail. However, when she touches the exposed bone, Gwendolyn suddenly pulls away, excuses herself, and leaves. Fearne realizes she picked up on something within Laudna with the touch and the three women go after Gwendolyn but are unable to coax her out of her room, Gwendolyn telling Laudna, \"I'm afraid of you and I don't know why.\" Imogen realizes Gwendolyn sensed Delilah , and tells Laudna they cannot let Percival know.\n\nMeanwhile, FCG decides to visit the temple of the Changebringer and Orym, Chetney, and Ashton go to the Matron of Ravens . They reach an old graveyard and the small temple there, the Altar of the Raven , and look for water to drink, trying to re-create the experience they had at the Duskmaven's temple in Jrusar , but find only a stairway leading down into pure darkness. The caretaker Othinon greets them and offers some of his lunch. Frustrated, Ashton opens one of the sarcophagi and climbs in, and Orym and Chetney share another. After endless moments of darkness and silence, Orym prays silently, saying, \"I'm sorry for your friend. I hope you're holding up. I hope we can help.\"\n\n![Orym and the Raven Queen - Jenny Dolfen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/98/Orym_and_the_Raven_Queen_-_Jenny_Dolfen.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20231023125416)\n\nSuddenly, all three see a faint white light, and Orym urges them to follow it. They see it shining down on a mound that rises into a humanoid outline, facing away, black-cloaked. It turns, removing its white mask to reveal a black void that pulls them in, and they look up to find themselves at the bottom of a pit. The Raven Queen has chains on her wrists, dangling into the hole. Ashton leads the way climbing a chain upward, but as they reach the top, the chains break. As they fall, giant raven wings appear from her back and she flies upward, breaking into hundreds of black ravens flying free. The three party members are left with a sense of being noticed and appreciated. On their way out, Ashton leaves a copper at the nearby Temple of the Dawnfather to show his disdain.\n\nMeanwhile, FCG visits the Horizon Temple of the Changebringer where he meets Osli Kámyda , who recognizes him immediately. FCG tells Osli he changed his life. He prays, saying he has a bad feeling about the upcoming mission and if something bad happens, make it happen to him instead of the others. He receives a vision of the Changebringer, with crimson tears running down her face. It tells him that dark days are ahead, but the brave can save what they care most about. She assures him they will watch over him always, as all the gods are in danger. FCG tells her they're coming, and that he thinks he's now found a purpose. Her request for his aid this time seems gentler, and FCG senses she is trying another approach to see if it works better.\n\nThe party reconvenes at the Sun Tree toward sunset, where they order crepes from a pushcart. Imogen asks the seller's name and when told it is Andrew, they immediately think it is Whitestone Andy , who threw dirt at Laudna when then were children. Imogen and Laudna refuse to take their crepes, but Ashton and Orym pay for them. Imogen angrily tells Andrew he should apologize for throwing dirt clods at little girls, but Andrew doesn't remember doing it fifty-ish years earlier. Struck by a thought, they ask if there were other Andys in town and learn yes, several-- three in his class alone. Feeling guilty, Imogen gives him a gold and apologizes.\n\nBells Hells return to the castle, and Ashton finds a book on the de Rolo family history as they all head to their beds.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e76-a_gathering_of_heroes"}

As part of this conversation, Fearne wanted to recenter herself by visiting her Nana Morri , and it was decided amongst the troop that perhaps a visit to the Fey Realm to try to reconnect before heading into a very dangerous unknown was a good idea. Upon asking Allura 's help, she transported you all and escorted you to the Ligament Manor .\n\nAfter a brief conversation, FCG and Nana Morri got excited about the prospect of a team building exercise amongst you all. After a conversations she wiped your memory of, she sent you on the first of three: the first one was an honesty-based expedition in which you all were in a ravine and had to reveal truths about yourselves and about your experiences in the world which allowed you to escape from this dangerous chasm. Completing that, you were sent to a test of communication, in which three volunteers had their sight robbed from them and were sent to walk without vision across very narrow and ever-winding land bridges with the possibility of falling into oblivion, which Ashton did, knocked off the edge by wasps. It was Orym that volunteered for the final round with real stakes this time as the bridge collapsed behind him. But you all succeeded at this second venture.\n\nWith the second success behind you, you were brought to the third and final part of your team building therapy session. You were transported by Nana Morri to the middle of a massive fey ruin, overgrown with vines and thorny brambles, faintly glowing remnants of whatever fey society fell here long ago, and you were introduced to two new creatures you hadn't seen before, these doppelganger -like fey creatures that apparently can not just take your form, but have been paying attention to your personalities, memories, and diving into your minds and thoughts since these whole number of therapy sessions began.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nNana Morri reiterates the rules: hidden somewhere in the area are three sections of ivory branch, each in a basin altar. Their task is to find all three and deposit them in the central pool. However, two of the party will be replaced by doppelgangers and attempt to sabotage this effort along with the \"denizens\" of the area. Matt passes out a card to each player, telling them whether they are a doppelganger or a player. A mist swirls around them and they are transported to a fey ruin with a central pool, surrounded by jungle. The hunt begins.\n\nOrym leaps to a high point for a better vantage point but sees nothing obvious. As Fearne moves to search, she is wrapped in stabbing brambles and restrained, but Ashton frees her, then suggests they all stick together until they find the first branch so they know what they're looking for. FCG casts Cure Wounds on Fearne, while Chetney , still in werewolf form, moves away while avoiding vine attacks but is wounded by acid-spraying flowers. Laudna sends Pâté on the search, then uses Wither and Bloom on some foliage, exposing the first altar and branch. Fearne casts Scorching Ray at another area of brambles in a doorway, burning them away but creating a fiery barrier there.\n\n![Kenny - Pyromeekorai](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/1d/Kenny_-_Pyromeekorai.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/175?cb=20231218000801)\n\nMeanwhile, Ashton uses his Hyper Rage to increase his speed, reach the branch Laudna exposed, pick it up, and reach the pool, but when he tries to throw it in, it bounces off an invisible barrier. Ashton picks it up again, and when he subsequently takes damage, so does the branch, losing one of its three hit points. Imogen discovers static blocks her Detect Thoughts , and when party members do Insight checks on each other, Matt has the target privately text him whether they are a doppelganger or not so he knows whether to use persuasion or deception to determine success. FCG uses Speak with Animals to ask a squirrel-like fey creature (named Kenny) which plants are dangerous, and is told the big walls are scary and some of the trees are dubious. Chetney's Grim Psychometry picks up a memory of fey elves frantically hiding objects as the area is under attack.\n\nSuddenly, a small fey quickling -like creature drops down from a tree, runs to Ashton, grabs the branch from his hands and runs off. Laudna sends Pâté after it, then clears more brush with another Wither and Bloom . Orym is then able to catch up to the creature and regain the branch with Seedling 's Grasping Vines . Fearne clears some of the ruins with Stone Shape , but a fey owl-like creature with a tentacle tongue restrains FCG and drags him along after it as it flies off. Ashton uses another Hyper Rage to catch up and bash the tongue, freeing FCG. Imogen then attacks the \"owl\" while Flying , destroying it. Meanwhile, Chetney claws and kills the quickling, and Orym picks up the branch, tucking it away.\n\nLaudna continues to clear brush with Wither and Bloom . Fearne tries to question the plants with Speak with Plants , but learns nothing and is wounded and restrained by a vine. Ashton manages to free her with an attack on the vines. Imogen's Inflict Wounds burns away more bushes and reveals another ivory branch, which she flies down and retrieves. FCG asks her to drop the branch down to him if she trusts him, and after Sam 's Insight 23 check, FCG trusts she really is Imogen. His Misty Step , however, puts him too close to more brambles, which attack and restrain him. Meanwhile, Chetney tries to climb a tree and realizes part of it is illusory. After searching, he finds the final ivory branch, jumps down and runs to the central pool, placing the branch in the Bag of Holding . Orym, with another branch, dashes to join him, while Imogen flies overhead with the third to the pool.\n\nLaudna positions herself where she can watch everyone, while Fearne readies Hold Person if Chetney does anything suspicious. Ashton joins her at the pool and holds a shove attack against her. FCG is still restrained and taking damage from a vine, but casts Divination , asking if Orym is the bad guy. After The Changebringer secretly responds, FCG shouts he thinks the Doppelganger is Chetney. Laudna summons her Hound of Ill Omen between Orym and Imogen, and readies Infestation against Orym.\n\nThe three branch-bearers stand ready, but Orym pulls out the Monocle of True Essence and studies Fearne first. Ashton moves to FCG and frees him from the brambles, and FCG joins the others at the pool. Orym counts down from three and he, Chetney, and Imogen all simultaneously drop their ivory branches into the pool, where they join together into a larger glowing ivory branch. Two doppelgangers walk up, joined by Nana Morri, who applauds their performance learning to trust each other despite what they were told. Imogen accepts the ivory branch and the fog that originally transported the party to this space returns. When they can see again, they are sitting in Ligament Manor with the tea still on the table. Allura greets them, asking if they enjoyed their naps.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe party thanks Nana Morri for the experience, and FCG says they learned a lot, although they're not sure which parts of the challenges came from Morri and which from them. Even though it was all a dream, the wounds the group suffered are real, as are the three objects they acquired.\n\nWhen asked if they're all right, Ashton replies that any one of them could still do something stupid at the wrong time, but they can tolerate and forgive each other. Orym points out they can't wait: the world needs saving now. Laudna shares Fearne 's concern that they're not up to saving the world by themselves, and thinks they should concentrate on smaller tasks they can succeed at, but Allura responds that their lower profile may help them succeed where the more well-known and powerful people they've encountered would fail. She hopes they can discover something to give them an edge when the time comes to assault Ruidus . Others will be taking part in that effort, and the party need not even come if they don't want to.\n\nImogen asks the others if it would be okay for her to give in to the pull of Ruidus to connect with it. The others support this, as long as she tells them first. Laudna brings up the Spark of Rau'shan , and Fearne has been thinking about it too. She now thinks maybe she was scared of something that was inevitable. She now kind of wants it, or at least wants to try it. Ashton can't think of anyone who should benefit from it as much as her. They decide right now is a good time, since Morri's around if something horrible happens.\n\nDuring a short rest, the party heals as much as possible, and divides the items they got. FCG takes the ivory branch (unattuning the grappling cannon), Chetney the Monocle of True Essence , and for now, Imogen takes the Scarf of Intrusive Intent . Ashton loans the Ring of Volcanic Flesh to Fearne. Morri is excited and proud that Fearne has decided to take the Shard, and suggests they all go up to the rooftop garden to do it. Once there, FCG casts Bear's Endurance on Fearne to give her temporary hit points, and uses Sympathetic Binding as well on Fearne, Ashton, and Laudna. Fearne summons Little Mister and casts Aura of Life on herself. Orym gives her his Potion of Heroism , increasing her temporary hit points to 10 and giving an additional d4 to saving throws. During the preparations, Imogen tells Ashton she's sorry they felt they had to hide their motivations and feelings. Laudna buries her head in Imogen's shoulder so she won't have to see and be tempted by the Spark of Rau'shan. With advantage from a Calm Emotions by Imogen, she resists Delilah 's temptations.\n\nChetney opens the Bag of Holding and removes the Shard with tongs, placing it near the funnel on Fearne's back. The crystal brightens as it approaches and Fearne begins feeling heat... and taking fire damage that increases each round. After several pulses of damage, FCG uses their Scatter Vigor ability to take health from Ashton and transfer it to Fearne. However, she fails a concentration check, loses her Aura of Life , and begins using Ashton's Ring of Volcanic Flesh for all three of its charges to reduce the burn damage somewhat, while FCG begins casting healing spells on her. Chetney uses the Monocle to notice three strange, invisible fey creatures watching from the trees.\n\n![Fearne, transformed - shalizeh7](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/17/Fearne%2C_transformed_-_shalizeh7.jpeg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20231221211743)\n\nFearne's skin is glowing and her eyes are flaming bright orange, and she begins lifting off the ground. As her ordeal continues, FCG takes more health from Ashton to pump into her, but she is brought perilously close to unconsciousness. FCG gives her a 5th-level Cure Wounds (taking fire damage themself in the process), but if they do another Scatter Vigor, it will send them into a rage. The party urges them to go ahead, and as FCG goes berserk, Chetney uses his Blood Curse of Binding on them, amplified, keeping them in place and unable to move while Imogen uses her telekinesis to pull FCG slightly away from Fearne. Meanwhile, the pain is almost euphoric for Fearne, who sees a vision of a flaming realm in a lost earlier time. As FCG hurls abuse at her, Nana Morri Silences them. Laudna casts Wither and Bloom twice, allowing Fearne to heal slightly as the topiaries curl and die, revealing bones beneath the leaves. Fearne also casts several healing spells on herself as she transforms into a being of flame. In her vision, she sees an immense flaming creature, unknown to her, and feels a sense of sadness and legacy.\n\nThe final fire damage leaves Fearne barely standing, but alive. She sees the flaming figure of her vision embrace her, transforming her into an incandescent being of pure fire, burning everyone around her. She slowly returns to herself, still flaming, still slightly floating, permanently transformed and with new abilities. Just then, FCG breaks free of Chetney's hold, but Orym immediately attacks with the flat of his blade, hitting him and pushing him back several times, but not causing enough damage to snap him out of his rage. FCG counterattacks, wounding Orym, but then succeeded in a saving throw and recovers himself, apologizing for losing control of himself.\n\n![Ashton and Fearne - Zhellers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/93/Ashton_and_Fearne_-_Zhellers.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20231220023153)\n\nChetney tries to touch the flaming Fearne, and is not hurt when she permits the touch, but it causes damage to Imogen when she touches her unaware. Imogen remembers that Fearne's shard was suppose to awaken Ashton's, and the party suggests they should touch. Hesitantly, Fearne clasps his transformed hand, and as they touch, the golden veins alight once again and he feels the sense of belonging to the ground, sensing its history as he has a vision of burrowing through the rock of Exandria to see a growing mountain range as the land forms in creation. Ashton suddenly grows a foot or two, his rocky arm swells, and shards and spikes of rock emerge from his body as he feels a new strength and sturdiness. As he emerges from his vision, he realizes he has new abilities, and can swim through the ground as though it were liquid.\n\nAshton and Fearne, hand in hand, run down the stairs of Ligament Manor and outside to explore their new abilities together as the surrounding, watching creatures begin to cheer and scatter in the gathering darkness of evening.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e80-a_test_of_trust"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E75-An Ancient Flame","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off: Bells Hells , in seeking answers to the strange history of Ashton and the unique ties it seems to have with some of the ancient history of Exandria , and hopefully finding some means of preparing for an eventual showdown with the enemies that walk the red moon , you head to the Shattered Teeth . You traversed the sea in a ghost ship . You went to the island of Kalutha . You trekked through the jungles and eventually found Evontra'vir , the Great Tree of Atrophy, at the bottom of a massive chasm surrounded by massive mountains. There, as you slunk into the lightless expanse, you met the ancient Gau Drashari -turned-death tree that sits between the realms of life and the beyond.\n\nYou asked a bit about your history in the Hishari and learned that, within you, lies the dormant shard of Ka'Mort , the empress primordial Earth titan . But there exists still, not too far from here, on another island in the Shattered Teeth, another remaining vestigial shard of the other primordial titan that was destroyed in the destruction of Domunas that created the islands of the Shattered Teeth. Upon given direction where this was, inquiring as to possible futures and possible failures through some visions and discussions, your time was cut short as the tree took notice of an invisible, floating, spying arcane orb. Upon shattering it, it opened a pathway to the mountaintop on which this shard is supposedly found, and sent you onto the next leg of your journey with haste. As you all stepped through, emerging from a leafless tree on the opposite end, you all find yourselves standing on a cold, snow-covered mountaintop.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nImogen Flies to the cavern entrance, carrying Orym with her, and uses the immovable rod and a rope so the others can join them, although Laudna opts to Spider Climb . Once there, they see there is a very thin passage leading further in and downward. Fearne wildshapes into a snow bat and explores further while communicating telepathically with Imogen, finding a blocked hole leading downward. Orym joins her and discovers the blockage is a charred orcish skull, which he pulls out, sending the rest of the skeleton plunging downward. Leaving Laudna, Chetney , and Ashton above, the others creep through with varying degrees of difficulty and fall about 20 feet into a cylindrical chamber which is significantly warmer than above and contains more bones and incinerated materials, along with what appears to be a magical brass ring. FCG 's Detect Magic finds that the floor of the chamber appears to be radiating magic.\n\n![Magma mephits by Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b9/Magma_mephits_by_Elaine_Tipping.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231024171418)\n\nEventually FCG uses Stone Shape to create a small hole in the floor, seeing the glow of magma rising from the chamber forty feet below, with small, glowing, impish creatures flitting about. The others join them, and Fearne (still in bat form) flies into the hole to the lowermost chamber where she realizes the creatures are speaking in an unknown language. She returns above, and when Ashton attempts to widen the hole, the whole floor falls down. Imogen catches the group with Fly and they see a small pool of magma surrounded by rocky ledges. There are no other visible openings. FCG casts Tongues on Fearne and she resumes her faun form. They notice the mephits are very short-lived, constantly being created from the magma, and dying, with therefore no concept of time or its passage. Fearne asks if they know about the shard of Rau'shan and the creatures recognize that name as \"The Creator\". The shard is within the lava and births them from it. There are tales of others who came seeking it and angered the spark, filling the chamber with fire.\n\n![Fearne and Ashton retrieving the shard - Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/3/35/Fearne_and_Ashton_retrieving_the_shard_-_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231016121305)\n\nAfter much discussion about how to reach the shard, Ashton decides to just Fly in and get it. The roiling calms slightly as he flies into the pool, raging, and he takes 34 points of initial fire damage, reduced by 7 by his Ring of Volcanic Flesh . Ashton immediately locates the burning-hot shard, but it is stuck in place. They take \n31 more fire damage as the others wait above, unable to see them within the lava pool. Fearne casts Fire Shield on herself and leaps into the magma to join Ashton, finding both Ashton and the shard immediately. She uses her Ring of Telekinesis to loosen the shard, and Ashton is then able to pull it free while they both continue to take damage. Ashton immediately flies both of them out of the lava, Ashton glowing orange from the heat he has taken. They land on the shore, but as they do, the mephits one by one crumple and die. The party notices that the gold-filled cracks in Ashton's body seem to be slightly gently healed, although some of Ashton's clothing is burn-damaged.\n\nThe shard is a bright orange-white cluster of crystals, about the size of a soccer ball as Ashton and Fearne clutch it still burning in their grasp. They all discuss what to do with the elemental spark now, with many suggestions that it should go to Fearne since Evontra'vir told them it was dangerous for one vessel to hold both shards. Ashton is drawn to it, continuing to take damage as he holds it. Fearne offers to take it from him but gives it back when it burns her as well. Imogen then uses Mage Hand to hold it in the air so they don't have to touch it, and although Chetney is very reluctant to touch the object to learn more about it with Grim Psychometry, he eventually does so, learning it is incredibly powerful. He catches a glimpse of a vision of the emotions of the titan it once formed a part of upon being released from their captivity before being consumed by blue-white light and sundered into millions of pieces.\n\nAshton holds the shard close to their chest, but senses only that it is looking for its vessel. Concluding it is not meant to be for him, the party tries to figure out how the new vessel would absorb the shard. Laudna suddenly realizes they have another artifact, the harness of Ludinus Da'leth , that was used to transfer life essences into the wearer, but Imahara Joe still has it, working to repair it. Orym suddenly notices a faint flash of light on the other side of the chamber, and sees five figures appear, two wearing the raiment of the Ruby Vanguard , two Reilora , and a robed figure in back-- an older elven man with long silver hair. He greets them, saying, \"Well now. You certainly have been busy, haven't you? I suppose the sting of failure is a magnificent motivator.\" Imogen immediately uses Telekinesis to throw lava at them.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![3x75 enemies](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/4/47/3x75_enemies.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20231016123424)\n\nAs the battle begins, they notice Ludinus is now wearing a white gem on his forehead. Ashton grabs the shard, while Imogen telekinetically pulls the smaller of the Reilora into the lava pool and Orym finishes him off using Seedling to slice him from 15 feet away. He then uses the sword's Grasping Vines to pull one of the soldiers into the lava, killing him instantly. Ludinus tells the group this is a rude way to deal with an extended olive branch, but then notices FCG's staff and notes they've been prying. He uses Telekinesis to grab and restrain Fearne, moving her 30 feet over the lava. The Reiloran Juggernaut uses Telekinetic Shove on Orym to pull him into melee, while Chetney has Ashton drop the shard into the Bag of Holding , then uses Invisibility . Fearne encases Ludinus in a Wall of Stone and Laudna hits the Juggernaut with a Blight .\n\nBoth Ashton and Imogen continue their attacks, then Orym attacks the Juggernaut, using pushing attacks to shove it into the lava. He leaps onto it and hits again, then action surges for three more hits, killing it and backflipping back to solid ground. Ludinus casts Dimension Door to escape the Wall of Stone and pulls Fearne close to him, saying they should go talk elsewhere. The party turns to attacking Ludinus, trying to get him to drop concentration on the Telekinesis holding Fearne, but fail to do so, and he Counterspells Fearne's Wall of Fire . When she attempts negotiation, he tells her that chance was over when they murdered his companions. Laudna summons the Hound of Ill Omen but it is killed by the one remaining guard and Ludinus's concentration continues to hold.\n\nImogen's Lightning Bolt kills the guard, and Ludinus finally fails his Concentration check. He prepares a 9th-level spell which Laudna barely Counterspells , and his Countercounterspell fails. Recognizing defeat but saying at least he has more information, he walks into the lava, melting into a pile of snow that turns into steam, not wanting to allow the party to get the final blow on him. Fearne grabs from the lava the cracked opal the simulacrum wore on his forehead and Chetney gets its robe, which appears to be magical.\n\nAshton is insistent they Teleport immediately, and they decide to go to Whitestone , where Imahara Joe was to be working on repairing the harness along with Percival de Rolo . FCG uses the Staff of Dark Odyssey to cast the spell, targeting the Sun Tree .\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e75-an_ancient_flame"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E71-Mist and Whimsy","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off, Bells Hells had sought out aid with an artifact they had uncovered that seemed tethered to parts of Ludinus Da'leth 's past. In doing so, you sought out Dancer , who has a tumultuous history with FCG , as well as heading back to Bassuras to bring their skill and talent to combine with that of Imahara Joe in hopes of discovering the true nature and/or the capabilities of this artifact once it were to be repaired or refurbished. Upon arriving there you found that it seems a lot of outside military force by interested temple factions or other military factions from around Exandria are starting to gather in the Hellcatch around the ground zero of where the Bloody Bridge currently still tethers the moon Ruidus into the sky.\n\nHere, you also discovered that Imahara Joe's shop had been shuttered up, and apparently had long been captured by Paragon's Call within the city, and they were forcing him to do work for Paragon's Call itself, and by proxy, the Ruby Vanguard . You managed to ruin entirely Paragon's Call within and foiled the plans and capabilities of General Ratanish , one of the secondary generals beneath Otohan Thull . Putting them to rest and covering your tracks, you saved Imahara Joe and another companion of his , also of quite intellect and capability. With the aid of Keyleth , sent them off to a safe space with her while she managed to handle her business in the time to come of growing tumult, and then sent you all to the rarely journeyed continent of clustered islands known as the Shattered Teeth , to seek information and answers surrounding the essence and mystery of Ashton 's past and current nature.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe party tumbles out of the tree portal into a foggy dense forest of tall corkscrewing black-and-white birches. It is nearing sunset. In the fog, they cannot tell much about the surroundings, but Orym notices many small creatures in the trees above and hears the ocean in the distance. They walk toward the sound and reach a cliff over a narrow black-pebbled beach. Imogen tries Sending to Jirana , but it fails. She casts Fly on herself and Orym, joined by Pâté , and they go up over 600 feet before finally breaking through the fog, but they can see only clouds below them, disturbed by a gargantuan distant undulating shadowy form.\n\nThey quickly descend and tell the others what they saw. The party moves northward as night falls, and they find themselves surrounded by tiny firefly-like glowing amphibious humanoids about an inch tall that are fuschia striped irregularly with teal. Periodically, they hear a low, rumbling whooshing sound. Laudna sends Pâté out scouting, and she steps into a large webbed footprint about seven feet across. They talk about whether it's wise to try to camp, finally deciding they need a long rest, so Fearne uses Plant Growth to create a shelter for the night.\n\n![Me - Elaine Tipping](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/59/Me_-_Elaine_Tipping.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230912125447)\n\nChetney takes first watch, noticing more of the tiny light-creatures gathering around them and the loud distant booming noise continuing. Laudna takes over the watch, timing the booms at every 15-30 minutes and noting more of the lizard-pixies gathering curiously. FCG takes the last watch as more and more of the pixies arrive. The aeormaton casts Speak With Animals and several land on his head, seeming to understand him but not being able to speak. They point to the direction the booms are coming from and indicate that \"people\" are everywhere around them. FCG pickpockets some dried meat from Chetney to feed them, then casts Detect Thoughts and realizes there are about forty of the creatures now. When FCG casts Tongues on one, they can communicate. The pixie (which is nameless and dubbed simply \"Me\") likes the food, and tells FCG the boom is a \"spray cannon\", an ocean blowhole. When he asks if they can visit one of their many surrounding villages, the creature tells him the party is very noisy and they don't want to bring the Smelly One, a large creature who can smell very well. The teal coloring on their bodies is actually what they apply to themselves to disguise their own odor so as not to be located. When FCG asks for some, the creature agrees, curls up in his hand, and defecates a teal-colored substance.\n\nWhen FCG asks if there are any larger people or visitors nearby, the pixie tells him there is Toriz , the Protector, who comes when there are big lights or sounds and helps save them from the one who smells. FCG suggest a light such as a big fire, and the lizard-pixies all grow happily excited at the prospect of fire so FCG promises them one. It is now morning, so FCG wakes the others and introduces them to the friendly creatures, telling them they need to make a big fire to call Toriz. The party suspects the Smelly One may be the immense flying sky-creature Orym and Imogen saw, but the reptile-pixie tells them the Smelly One crawls rather than flies, although it is large, with many legs, and changes colors.\n\n![FCG in the rain - KunKunGun](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/54/FCG_in_the_rain_-_KunKunGun.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20230912192621)\n\nNow surrounded by more than a hundred eager reptile-pixies, they move to a rocky area that contains the weathered remnants of a former campsite. Chetney uses Grim Psychometry to learn the campsite was attacked and its occupants killed by a massive beast after they lit a campfire. FCG tells the others about the concealing effects of the pixie poop, and they communicate to the creatures they would all like \"rain\" from them. In return, Fearne summons Little Mister and Chetney uses a Crimson Rite to make his chisel flame. Now covered in lavender-scented pixie-poop, they gather firewood and build a bonfire, then spread out around it as the approximately 300 watching reptile-pixies watch eagerly.\n\nLaudna sends a Fireball into the woodpile exploding it into massive flames, and the pixies are entranced. Suddenly, Orym notices what seems like a piece of the volcanic rock begin to move and alerts Chetney. The creature is only about ten feet from Chet, a hulking multi-legged beast the same color and texture as the surrounding rock. Chetney squawks, drawing its attention, and as it whips around, smelling him out, it bites.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nChetney takes massive bite damage but is still conscious. Orym leaps off the rocks where he's standing, runs as far as he can toward him, and then uses Seedling 's Grasping Vines to pull himself into the Smelly One 's face and Bait and Switch to move Chetney away. Imogen uses Summon Crimson Shade to summon a Hex Mind reilora and both she and the reilora hit it with spells. The wounded Chetney backs away from the creature, who tries to bite where he used to be and finds Orym there instead, hitting with a claw for significant damage. FCG 's Compulsion forces it to move away on its next turn, while Laudna first hexes it and then hits it with two Eldritch Blasts . Ashton enters a Probability rage and runs toward the Smelly One, while Fearne hits it with Scorching Ray .\n\n![Ashton carrying Orym to safety - Jenny Dolfen](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/7a/Ashton_carrying_Orym_to_safety_-_Jenny_Dolfen.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230917124706)\n\nSuddenly, they hear a heavy impact about 500 feet away, and the Smelly One looks frightened. Orym makes a goading attack, drawing its attention, and Imogen hits with a solid Lightning Bolt . However, the creature retaliates against Orym, hitting with a bite and claw (although Laudna is able to negate a natural 20 with Silvery Barbs ), wounding him severely before it is Compelled to move away before shaking it off. FCG casts Healing Word on Orym, and Laudna casts Shocking Grasp through Pâté followed by Infestation . Ashton drags Orym into a small hollow and guards him.\n\nThere is a long, low croak, and the area grows darker as a shadow falls across the area and an immense black toad leaps down. As its mouth opens to croak again, Fearne can see warm light and a partially furnished living room within the creature. The Smelly One looks terrified, and Orym continues to attack it. Imogen contacts the toad telepathically, saying, \" Toriz ? We were sent by The Voice of the Tempest .\" The toad acknowledges this, and wordlessly tells Imogen to keep safe a moment. She yells this to the others, and they stand by as the Smelly One runs away as fast as possible.\n\n![Jirana and Toriz - Lap Pun Cheung](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nInside Toriz is an older female turtle-humanoid, called a galapa in this region, hanging onto a handle built into a bolted-down rocking chair. She greets them warmly, confirming that she is Jirana and the toad is Toriz , her companion, home, and guardian. Jirana is aware that something strange is happening in the world. Ashton introduces the group, and himself as \"Ashton of the Hishari \", and tells her they need help with a particular tree. She welcomes them inside the toad.\n\nJirana tells them the Smelly One is Bari Mondolo , a child of the reef serpent Esquala, which protects the Utu Reef far north of the island. The tiny reptile pixies are dolabos . Orym describes the immense creature he and Imogen saw the day before, and she says it was likely one of the Cloud Jaws, similar to a sky whale, that keep skyships from traveling through the fog of the Fool's Curtain by attacking any that try. The spirits of the land in the Shattered Teeth have \"a unique way of keeping time\", and although by Jirana's reckoning she is about 120 years old, to outsiders that would be over 400 years.\n\n![Map - Islands of the Shattered Teeth](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAshton tells Jirana he was told to say he is a titan of blood, and that she might know something about the Hishari . Jirana asks why they're looking for the Tree of Atrophy, and Ashton thinks it might help clarify his situation. She explains that Evontra'vir , a Gau Drashari that survived the explosion of Domunas that created the Shattered Teeth, took on himself the sorrows and losses of The Calamity and became a window into the realm of death, the Tree of Atrophy on the island of Kalutha . The islands of the Teeth, however, shift constantly, making maps difficult to keep current. There are frequent shipwrecks on this island, and she has scavenged them, finding among other things a fairly recent map showing the movement of the islands. Chetney thinks he could repair one of the shipwrecks for the journey to Kalutha... or they could just Teleport , although since they are unfamiliar with it there is some risk of a mishap. By boat, it would take two to three days, and they could try to flag down a Wanderman Assembly ship on the north side of the island.\n\nAfter some thought, Jirana has another, more dangerous option for them. She pulls out an ornate, slightly cracked compass, the lost compass of the Dread Captain Novos , which is attuned to the island of Kalutha. Novos was a privateer whose ship the Crimson Abyss was eventually captured by the forces of the Ossended Host , but he made a \"dark deal\" and now he and his ship haunt the region. Placing his compass in the water would summon them, and they might be able to reach a mutually beneficial arrangement. When Chetney uses Hunter's Bane on the compass, he has a vision of a cannon-holed ship in a storm, Captain Novos shouting his fury to the gods. A bolt catches him in the forehead and he falls. Despite the danger, the party decides they want to try using the ghost ship.\n\nJirana warns them to be sure they actually want to hear the answers to any questions they ask Evontra'vir. Ashton follows up with a question: There were two titans who died here, Ka'Mort and Rau'shan . Jirana tells them she dabbles in herbal remedies and gives them several potions and balms. FCG confesses he doesn't feel like a very good therapist since he doesn't have life experience to call on, and Jirana says he needs to learn to accept help as well as give it. Perhaps he can come back someday and they can talk a bit.\n\nThey say fond goodbyes, and Jirana offers to have Toriz transport them all to the shore. They all grab handles except Chetney, and Toriz takes off leaping. After a very short time, the toad stops and the party says a final goodbye before Toriz's mouth opens and everyone but Ashton exits onto the beach. Ashton hangs back, asking, \"How do you grieve if you don't know what was taken from you?\" Jirana tells him to focus on what he's gained, rather than the loss. When he joins the others, the toad's mouth closes as they walk out to the ocean.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e71-mist_and_whimsy"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E79-To Hurt Is to Heal","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after traversing the odds and ends of Exandria , finishing in the Shattered Teeth to seek some answers and finding an artifact that is somewhat involved in the elemental primordial history of Ashton and the Hishari people that his parents created and destroyed, you returned to Whitestone to prepare for a journey as a recon operation to the moon Ruidus to discover what is transpiring there to prepare for the eventual assault that the forces of Exandria are preparing for. On the eve of your journey, a ritual was attempted and hijacked in secret by Ashton to pursue what was understood to be his destiny. However, it proved to be too powerful and nearly destroying him twice, through the will of his strength, his constitution, and a couple of well-placed magical items and spells, survived, losing an arm, gaining an arm, and coughed up the Spark of Rau'shan , while seemingly something has stirred within him since this.\n\nHowever, in doing this, it broke much of the trust and the calm within the group of Bells Hells, and in this tumultuous period of time, this fracture has caused you all to take a pause on your journey toward the red moon . Deciding that, one, Fearne , who was at the epicenter of confusion and hurt in the midst of this, wanted to visit her Nana and consider the Fey Realm may be a decent place to try to take a rest to recover and rekindle the trust of the troop. Arriving back in the familiar space of the Ligament Manor in the Fey Realm , your Nana Morri , Morrigan herself, the Fatestitcher, the grand, terrifying hag that exists in this shadowed region of the Fey Realm , welcomed you all back, as well as realizing that your parents have come here as well, absconding from the Hellcatch Valley and looking for a place of peace and/or safety in the midst of all the chaos that is surrounding the Hellcatch. Upon arrival and some comfort, some interesting conversations transpired in which FCG decided to offer the idea of team building exercises of some sort of a good mental health retreat for all of you to work together and try to figure out ways to resolidify these binds, which excited Nana Morri , who eagerly agreed to aid you in this endeavor. And as her cackles echoed through the reaches of the tree itself that is the skeletal structure of Ligament Manor, you all, those of you who took them, sip upon your tiki drinks and consider what lies in the days ahead of you here where time seems to slow to a crawl under Nana Morri.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Fearne and Birdie - Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/0/0b/Fearne_and_Birdie_-_Cha_Cha_Rae.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20231215043027)\n\nChetney delicately asks Fearne about Nana Morri and her deals, learning that Fearne believes the bushes in the garden of Ligament Manor are people whose deals didn't work out. Chetney's deal with Morri would be to be young again. FCG goes to plan the day's activities with Nana Morri while Fearne speaks privately to Birdie about Morri's hints. Birdie and Fearne go for a stroll in the rooftop garden, and Birdie explains Hondir went to Aeshanadoor when they all abandoned their Hideaway. Fearne finally asks Birdie directly if she has something to tell her.\n\nBirdie is at first evasive, but eventually reveals that she met her husband Ollie Calloway at the Unseelie Court where he was imprisoned. At that time, she was in a romantic entanglement with Sorrowlord Athion Zathuda . She slowly developed feelings for Oleander, but was already pregnant with Fearne by Zathuda. When the baby was about to be born, Zathuda took Birdie to a hilltop in Exandria under the light of the red moon Ruidus , ensuring the child would be Ruidusborn . Zathuda then lost interest in Birdie, and she fled the Twilight Citadel with Ollie and Fearne, living as a family until Ruidus suddenly began appearing in the Fey Realm . At that point, she, Ollie, and Ira Wendagoth stole the Moontide Crown from the Malleus Key being built and left Fearne with Morrigan to keep her safe from Zathuda.\n\nMeanwhile, Orym has a conversation with Ashton , telling them to feel what they're going to, but the group cares about them. It's up to Bells Hells to stop the threat to the world, and Ashton needs to stay focused on that. Ashton admits he really likes the group, and Orym asks to be lifted up and kisses his forehead.\n\nInside, Allura is talking to the others, telling them that she has been in groups that had similar bumps in the road, and in her case the group fractured. Imogen suddenly removes her Circlet of the Hidden Eye , saying she feels as though if she hadn't been wearing it, she would have picked up on Ashton's plans in time to stop them. Eventually FCG returns with Morri, but his memory of their actual conversation has been removed although he's pretty sure they planned some great activities.\n\nWhen everyone has gathered again, Fearne tells the group that Zathuda is her biological father, and they recognize the Sorrowlord's link to the Ruby Vanguard and the building of the Fey Realm Malleus Key. Orym reminds them all that the group may have to kill both Fearne's father and Imogen's mother . When they remember that Zathuda tried to kill Morri on their last visit, Morri says it isn't the first time Zathuda has come for Fearne. She assumes it has something to do with her connection to Ruidus. When they learn Zathuda is titled \"Bearer of the Lightless Flame\" and bears a weapon known as the Blade of the Black Flame , Imogen tries to use that to convince Fearne she truly has a connection to fire and should accept the Spark of Rau'shan .\n\nThey show Nana Morri the crystal and she inspects it avidly, recognizing the kindred Shard of Ka'Mort within Ashton. However, when FCG suggests Fearne's parentage might make her a suitable recipient of the Spark, Morri responds that the Fey are removed from the Primordials ; they are at opposite ends of the magical ancients. At Chetney's insistence, Morri reluctantly returns the Spark to them. Allura suggests that the removal of the Moonweaver could upset the balance between the Fey Courts, allowing one to gain more ascendancy.\n\nMorri then brings them all tea and explains the upcoming team-building activities she and FCG planned. She has chosen three items, and each of them is a potential prize. The spirits of the surrounding area have rearranged it slightly for the various challenges, one each for communication, trust, and honesty. They choose honesty first and as smoke billows out from Morri's belly face, they find themselves elsewhere, standing in the Fey jungle on the edge of a deep chasm. Nana Morri pulls out a brass-rimmed green lensed monocle and throws it into the ravine. She tells them they must work together to find it, but the unclimbable chasm listens only to honesty. They must speak their secrets to succeed. A sphere of magic suddenly encloses them and they bounce into the chasm.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\nThe magical sphere plummets into the ravine, releasing them at its bottom, with the Monocle of True Essence nowhere in sight. They figure out they must tell truths in order to find it and escape, so they begin:\n\n![Episode 79 Bells Hells](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/b/b7/Episode_79_Bells_Hells.jpeg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20231209041529)\n\n- FCG enjoys eating silver more than copper. A column of stone lifts up.\n- Imogen is genuinely scared to meet her mom again. Stone steps emerge from a cliff wall.\n- Chetney says wood is better than metal. They discover there are leeches in the muck they're standing in.\n- Laudna and Delilah both want the Spark of Rau'shan , deep down inside, and Laudna is having trouble separating her own desires and opinions from Delilah's. The stone steps create a stone bridge and a vantage point.\n- Imogen loves Laudna deeply, but is disgusted at the thought of Delilah watching them all the time. A crumbled city pushes up from the mud.\n- Orym is constantly super lonely, especially at night.\n- FCG sometimes pities the others because they're alive and don't do enough with their opportunities, especially Chetney. More ruins emerge and Laudna climbs onto them for a better vantage.\n- Orym has sometimes wondered if Chetney really is his father.\n- Ashton is the reason the Jiana Hexum robbery went wrong. The ruins continue to emerge and they discover by climbing up on them, they can eliminate areas the monocle isn't in.\n- Fearne thinks they're going to fail to save the world.\n- Chetney is afraid the dwindling interest in wood will make his toys and himself obsolete. Some of the ruins begin to crumble. Orym climbs up to another high point.\n- Every time FCG hurts or kills something, it feels really good and his stress level goes down.\n- Imogen has tried talking to the gods her whole life but they never respond. She thinks she's tainted and doesn't know if she wants to save gods that don't love her. Two separate paths upward are completed with separate vantage points.\n- Laudna points out they could pull out of saving the world at any time and she fantasizes about doing it. Rain begins to wash away some of the muck and Orym spots a green glint. He leaps toward it and manages to recover the monocle. Everyone starts climbing up the two separate paths upward.\n- Fearne sometimes does \"stuff\" to the others while they're sleeping. Like... look at them. Nothing weird.\n- Ashton worries most of them could end up killing one of the others. Even Orym, although at least he'd be gentle. Laudna asks Orym how he feels about being the only normal one in the group, and he admits he's thought about how to neutralize each of them.\n- FCG worries he's put too much faith in the Changebringer , who might betray them all because she might not really care about him.\n- Imogen was disappointed in Fearne for not taking the shard. Laudna agrees with her.\n- Orym really misses Dorian , but is conflicted if that's okay. Multiple floating mushrooms appear which half of the group rides over to the other half in a bush almost at the top of the ravine, but Fearne is the last and hers starts sinking.\n- Laudna tries to make Pâté tell a truth but he doesn't have feelings.\n- Ashton feels worse that he fucked up Fearne's life worse than his own, and he should have died instead. This gets Fearne to safety.\n- Chetney grew up in the Bramblewood outside of Westruun . When he was a kid, he returned from learning to make toys and discovered his family gone while Errevon the Rimelord (an elemental Primordial ) was attacking Tal'Dorei . Chetney was angry, but now believes anyone he gets close to will look for a reason to leave him.\n![Fey bird creatures - ZioCorvid](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/6/6e/Fey_bird_creatures_-_ZioCorvid.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231209024140)\n\nWith this final truth, a flock of strange bird-like creatures with a thumbless hand instead of a head fly to them, dropping each of them at the top of the chasm where Morrigan awaits. Imogen hugs Chetney, telling him they won't leave him.\n\nThe next exercise is Communication. They find themselves transported to an underground chamber with a glowing orb on a central platform over a chasm. Three walkways emerge from the platform in snaking patterns. Morri tells them the orb is a thunder wasp hive and shows them a beautiful scarf which she tears in thirds, then causes skin to grow over the eyes of volunteers Chetney, Imogen, and Ashton, and they are blind. Morri transports them to the opposite ends of the walkways leading into the center. The task is for the others to verbally guide the blind ones over the winding walkways to reach them safely.\n\nChetney is first, and they discover if they speak too loudly, a swarm of wasps emerges from the hive onto the pathway, or attacks one of the watchers. FCG finds it very hard to remain quiet and is attacked multiple times, and two swarms are on the walkway. Chetney changes to his hybrid wolf form, and manages to stay on the walkway when he encounters the swarms and reaches the other side. Imogen goes next, but this time, skin grows over the mouths of Orym and FCG and they are unable to give directions. Liam slips once and a swarm appears. Imogen tries casting Shock Flare before entering the swarm but they're immune to lightning. However, she is able to stay on the path after being stung.\n\n![Orym's challenge - Jake Wennik](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nFor Ashton's turn, only Imogen and Fearne can give directions. Liam can't stifle a moan and a swarm appears,s causing Taliesin to have to make a dexterity save, which he fails, plummeting off the path only to be saved by Morri's magic. She offers them a last chance to succeed, but this time, if the blindfolded one steps off the path, they will die. Orym volunteers, and chooses Imogen and Chetney to give directions... but this time, they have only five minutes to complete the course. With excellent directions, he completes the course safely and Morri hands him the Scarf of Intrusive Intent as the prize.\n\nMorrigan waves her hands and magically transports them to the next location, deep in a Fey Realm forest surrounded by ruins. In front of them is a 20-foot wide well filled with mirror-like water, with three altars somewhere in the ruins, each bearing a section of white ivory branch. They must gather all of them and place them in the water, but the two doppelgangers who will secretly replace two of the party will attempt to mislead them and prevent this.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e79-to_hurt_is_to_heal"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E77-The Promise and the Price","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo last we left off: Bells Hells , after their excursion to the Shattered Teeth , managed to flee by the skin of their teeth by avoiding what appeared to be, towards the end of the conflict, a simulacrum of Ludinus Da'leth , who took a bit of information from that conflict. You fled with with your target, a remaining spark of one of the ancient Primordial Titans , particularly flame . As part of the experience, you also Teleported back to Whitestone , and after a little bit of a bumpy return (because some people just can't seem to roll decent on these Teleports ), returned to Whitestone to find that many of the other allies that you've made through this ever-growing, mounting danger in the middle of the Hellcatch Valley have come together to discuss the next plan of events. In this time, you went into the War Room, and made some new friends as well as met some old ones, and altogether began to throw on the table what information you had acquired and what needed to happen next.\n\nIt was decided, as the large world of Exandria currently gathers itself, everyone who might be accessible and available and driven to take arms against this threat that Ludinus and the Ruby Vanguard has built in the center, the heart of Marquet , others still throughout the world continue to be drawn to his cause and that division grows ever stronger throughout the world. As they begin to reach out to those they can, the attention is high on them, their history before them and know that there is an expectation of their arrival without a knowledge of what lies beyond the Bloody Bridge above the Malleus Key and Ruidus proper on the other side. You volunteered to be the recon team to go to Ruidus to see what awaits everyone there, and return when you felt the information you gathered was helpful or it was too dangerous. You asked for a couple of things. You met Lady Allura Vysoren , who is looking into acquiring what she can to help you on this journey. Some possible plotting for how you can sneak into the place you previously were witness to the development and release of the Malleus Key itself, and found what wasn't Whitestone Andy but a fine churro salesman here in the middle of Whitestone. But upon taking an evening's rest, contemplating the events of the day and the days to come, the mounting anxiety of what lies before you, in the middle of the night Laudna has woken up Imogen with interest for events as the evening progresses.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\n![Opening the door - UsikuNox](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/5/51/Opening_the_door_-_UsikuNox.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20231114050416)\n\nIn the middle of the night, Laudna wakes Imogen and Fearne for their pre-arranged surreptitious exploration of Whitestone Castle . Gwendolyn de Rolo 's reaction to Laudna made Laudna curious to see if walking around will jog her memories and help explain what happened to her. In her childhood she would sometimes seek refuge in the tunnels beneath and throughout Whitestone Castle . She remembers a dusty bedchamber where she was once imprisoned, and they stealth in search of it, eventually locating the kitchen and from there, a back hallway leading upward to locked grand double doors that Laudna recognizes. Her lockpicking fails, so Imogen casts Summon Crimson Shade and has the answering reiloran open the door.\n\nInside, the dust-covered room appears to be that of Percival 's deceased parents, but Laudna remembers being held captive there and finding a secret panel behind a bookcase. When she opens it, however, it has been bricked up with a note, \"Clever as you are, there is nothing for you here. Now go find your mother and apologize.\" They deduce the current Lord and Lady de Rolo blocked it to protect it from their exploring offspring. Fearne Stone Shapes a passage through to reveal a long, dark, descending stairway into a large furniture- and equipment-filled, dusty abandoned laboratory that they deduce was once Delilah Briarwood 's. Fearne's flame light suddenly dims as the temperature drops, and behind Laudna a ghostly human form rises up and attacks.\n\nLaudna casts Hunger of the Shadow but the creature is immune to its necrotic damage. She then assumes her Form of Dread, looking much more like Delilah than normal, and the ghost seems to recognize her, hitting her with a Withering Touch . Fearne casts Produce Flame on it, but although it takes damage, it ignores her and concentrates on Laudna as two more spirits emerge and immediately also fixate on the warlock. As Imogen and the reilora ( Sivaana ) also attack, they too are ignored although both cause damage. Now surrounded, Laudna summons her Hound of Ill Omen and makes her appearance even more like Delilah's before summoning three Mirror Images , two of which are quickly destroyed by the ghosts' attacks. Imogen destroys one ghost with lightning and damages another, and Laudna kills the two remaining with Eldritch Blasts .\n\nSuddenly, they all hear a voice: \"Alexander, Tethany, Vincent.\" It is Delilah, identifying the ghosts as former servants at the castle, and \"useful subjects\". They have found some of her additions: a place for Sylas to rest and for Delilah to experiment in the name of the Whispered One . She and Laudna are bound to one another, and she invites Laudna's questions.\n\n![Laudna & Delilah - Sabira Langevin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/2c/Laudna_%26_Delilah_-_Sabira_Langevin.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/240?cb=20231113113803)\n\nImogen asks her what she wants, and Delilah responds she wishes nothing more than to outlive the world, uncovering its mysteries to keep to herself and her love. Laudna asks her aid against Predathos and Delilah assures her their interests are aligned. That's why she's loaned Laudna her gifts. The one Delilah received her own gifts from has little to gain from the gods' destruction. Delilah gave up everything to a god, and his power is now in Laudna as well. While the Whispered One may be biding his time, his tendrils are still in this realm. And if he goes away, so do Delilah and Laudna. Laudna demands more help in the battle, but in turn, Delilah demands more of Laudna, who remembers the hunger she felt from the shattered gnarlrock [1] and from taking Bor'Dor 's soul. [2] Delilah demands Laudna give her more life and power so she may endure. It's possible she could gain her own form and soul again and leave Laudna, but that's a long way away. If it were to happen, Delilah would find a way to bring Sylas back.\n\nDelilah tells Fearne she senses a darkness within her that's intriguing. In time, she could become something terrible and gorgeous, and Delilah urges her to embrace it. Imogen is something beyond terrestrial: a child of the God Eater with power of unpredictable limits. Imogen may choose the future of this world, unless her mother makes the choice for her. Telling them to think about it and that she's always here, Delilah vanishes.\n\nImogen assures Laudna they'll find a way to free her since Delilah's not more powerful than the gods, but Laudna isn't so sure. Delilah created a god. Laudna will do whatever is necessary, and tries to get Imogen to promise to move on and be happy if Laudna must die in the process. Imogen promises, but will do everything she can to prevent it. Laudna says there's no harm in playing by Delilah's rules for now, because in the end, it's Laudna's game. Both Imogen and Laudna are now firmly sure they need to save the gods.\n\nOn their way out, Laudna remembers that an adjoining room held a bed bearing a coffin, but when they investigate the room's contents have been destroyed. Laudna flips over the table and Fearne sets everything flammable on fire. On the stairs, Delilah's voice creeps into Laudna's mind, saying: \"We will work together. I need you to flourish so that I might as well. Bound as we are, I do care for you.\" Laudna's response: \"Let's do terrible and beautiful things.\"\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Orym and Fearne - Shara Maestache](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/15/Orym_and_Fearne_-_Shara_Maestache.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20231114160354)\n\nIn the morning, Orym tells Fearne how much he loves watching her embrace Bells Hells and he's gotten her something: the spyglass he stole aboard the Crimson Abyss as a replacement for the one she stole from Captain Xandis and Orym returned. In return, she confesses that one time she actually didn't give him Guidance when she said she did because she was annoyed. [3] When they join the others, it is snowing in Whitestone and Chetney quickly crafts a sled. The women share their experiences during the night and suddenly realize they left very obvious signs of their presence in the secret room. Ashton proposes taking some time to have fun before all the serious stuff starts later that day. FCG asks Chetney why he's part of this dangerous mission, and the answer is to create a legacy: to make a difference and do something he'll be remembered for. Orym tells FCG he's a really great guy, and after a pause, FCG responds simply, \"Thanks\". Ashton points out they just accepted a compliment, and FCG says they've learned it's easier than deflecting. He's starting to feel like part of the team. Laudna gives him the wok they stole last night, and although FCG is a little hesitant, he accepts it.\n\n![Imogen at the Temple - cvleart](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe group heads outside and finds a snow-covered slope. Orym and Chetney team up on the sled while Ashton and FCG are on the wok. Team Sled does a masterful job, ending up well into the city, but Team Wok goes right into a snow pile. Back at the castle, they learn there will be a meeting later that afternoon, when both Allura Vysoren and Cassandra de Rolo have arrived. Imogen hangs back in the town and finds the Temple to the Dawnfather . Inside, she is approached by Brazilda , an older priestess, who gives her advice on prayer and faith. Imogen tells the Dawnfather that they're trying to help the gods and if they succeed, hopefully the gods can help Laudna. She asks for his help in the coming struggle. As she leaves, she sees the statue of the Matron of Ravens , goddess of death.\n\nMeanwhile, Orym drops by the Whitestone branch of Gilmore's Glorious Goods and buys three potions of healing . Although the goods have been bought out in preparation for potential coming battles, Orym notices a Potion of Heroism that was missed, and buys it. He also drops by the Slayer's Cake and orders pastries and one pie (for him) to be delivered later to the Castle .\n\n![Ashton's conversation with Fearne - Suraelis](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nMeanwhile, Ashton asks Fearne on a walk to the Heart of Whitestone , the clock tower built by Percival de Rolo . There, he tells her he believes that if they die on this mission, no one would miss him because the only people who care would be right there with him. Fearne brings up the shard of Rau'shan , reminding Ashton he's said he always wanted a sister. Ashton corrects her: He has always wanted family. When he says \"sister\", \"You're still hot and otherwise and definitely, wow, you got it going on.\" Fearne thinks the shard should go to him, but Ashton thinks the group won't let him do what needs to be done with it. He needs her to promise they'll find a way to make it happen, together, without the others knowing, and if it goes bad, try to save his life. If he dies, steal his shit before they know because he doesn't want the others to have anything. Fearne doesn't fully understand but agrees, tells him she thinks he's pretty hot, too, and runs away.\n\nBack at the Castle, Cassandra de Rolo has arrived. Allura is already there and they all gather in the War Room, where Percival suggests potential distractions at the Bloody Bridge site. One is to get close to a major mechanical device with one of the two objects he has crafted, which scramble the larger mechanisms when activated and can be set off with a one-minute timer. Allura has volunteered to go with them to create illusions en masse for them, bolstered by meat to leave a real mess behind when there is an illusion of a creature being killed. She also gives them two Scrolls of Mass Nondetection , a Scroll of Greater Restoration, a Scroll of Dimension Door, three healing potions, a potion of speed, two potions of gaseous form, and a jeweled baking tin worth 1000 gold for casting Heroes' Feast . Allura also confirms the reilorans suppress or reduce the effectiveness of healing magic. Cassandra will provide them all goggles and Allura can Teleport them all to near the Malleus Key site. The group plans to leave later that afternoon.\n\nChetney suggests they might want to also utilize the Quintessence Array before leaving, by testing it on a magical creature from the Parchwood Timberlands around Whitestone, but they decide that would take too long. Fearne and Ashton admit they're proposing to utilize the shard, Ashton pointing out there are facilities and experienced magic users in Whitestone to deal with any consequences. Ashton requests privacy while they absorb the shard, and Percy suggests the Ziggurat for both privacy and safety. He leads them far downward beneath the castle directly under the Sun Tree to an area filled with other researchers.\n\nThe group ascends the stairs of the pyramidal structure to the top, now a simple open platform with a memorial plaque inset in the floor. Ashton asks that all of them but he and Fearne descend again and Chetney gives them the Quintessence Array . Fearne starts to put it on Ashton and the others question this, but Ashton assures them Fearne is taking the shard and she hesitantly goes along. The others move away, down the sides, giving Ashton and Fearne the requested privacy.\n\n![Ashton kissing Fearne - Sech Bravo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAshton tells Fearne that if things go badly, she should scream for the others. Ashton quickly dons the harness, telling Fearne this is what he needs: to save everybody. Fearne is still very hesitant and frightened, but Ashton keeps talking, telling her it will be fine and if it isn't, shit happens. Plus, she promised. At the last moment, Ashton hugs her and gives her a big kiss, causing her to say, \"Well, now I don't know if I want to put this in there.\" Ashton responds: \"Fucking do it! It's never happening again anyway! That's the one you get.\"\n\n![Ashton transforming - TheBlackRibbon](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nJust holding the shard, Fearne begins taking fire damage. She holds it near the funnel on the harness and as the runes light up, it begins hovering there and she releases it. As the pain blooms within Ashton, he rages, the golden lines holding his body together starting to glow. He succeeds on his first Constitution save, but a chunk of his shoulder cracks off and shatters. Other parts of his body also crack off and burn, and as Fearne panics Ashton tells her repeatedly not to interfere despite the pain and horrific injuries. Imogen hears some of their conversation and telepathically asks Ashton if Fearne is all right, but hears only repeatedly: \"From the earth, of the earth, to the earth...\" Ashton's eyes are now just burning coals and his entire right arm has fallen off. Imogen runs up the ziggurat followed by the others, and sees what is happening. Ashton is growing brighter and hotter and Imogen uses Telekinesis trying to hold his body together. Healing potions evaporate before reaching his mouth. FCG casts Death Ward while Fearne casts Aura of Life .\n\nContinuing to take damage, Ashton goes unconscious for the first time but the Death Ward brings him back. Those near Ashton are also taking damage. FCG and Fearne cast healing spells but they are almost immediately wiped out, and Fearne's Aura of Life is the only thing keeping Ashton alive as he regains one hit point each time he drops to zero. Imogen frantically unbuckles the harness and Orym's Grasping Vines knock it off Ashton, then Gust blows it away. It has no effect as the Shard has already transferred into Ashton's body. FCG casts Aura of Vitality to continue pumping a few hit points each turn. On a failed Con save, however, Ashton's body explodes. The Ring of Temporal Salvation changes time to a moment earlier, bringing him back to life, but itself is destroyed, and there are five more rounds to go. Laudna, Imogen, and Chetney back up, trying to get away from damage if Ashton explodes again. FCG and Fearne continue to pump in healing and Ashton continues making Con saves. He goes unconscious virtually every round but the Aura of Vitality brings him back each time. FCG's Divine Intervention fails. The DC rises to 15 for the final two saves, and Ashton succeeds on both.\n\nThe heat begins to subside as Ashton falls unconscious, then erupts in steam before cooling. His arm is restored, appearing to be heavy, muscular molten rock. The golden veins are gone, replaced by glowing orange. Ashton thanks Fearne for trusting and saving him, and she kicks his face, shouting, \"I am never listening to you again!\"\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e77-the_promise_and_the_price"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E72-Phantasmal Parley","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nLast we left off, Bells Hells had traversed across Exandria in an instant at the behest of The Voice of the Tempest to one of the many islands that make up the Shattered Teeth from beyond the fog curtain . They landed upon the island of Slival . Upon wandering through the strange dense forests and black rock cliffs and beaches, you encountered strange flying frog-like pixie creatures . You befriended some, and requested a bunch to shit on you. You found out about a guardian upon this island in hopes maybe they could guide you to your individual of interest, The Shore Shrew . You, at the request of these creatures, lit a massive bonfire at one of the hilltops, which called the attention of a dangerous, sightless beast that began to attack Chetney and the rest of the group.\n\nIn defending them and trying to gain control of the battlefield, a massive shadow grew in the sky, where an incredibly large blackened toad creature slammed into the ground and revealed itself to be the living abode of Jirana , the Shore Shrew that you were seeking. After managing to knock away the creature of danger, you were invited into her home and answered a number of your questions, presented some possible opportunities to get to your destination, the island of Kalutha . You decided the best route was to take an enchanted compass that belonged to a dread captain who runs a ghost ship. After taking a moment to rest, enjoying some tea and some light conversation, the toad homestead bounded across the island and has just deposited you on the northeastern island shore to find the rest of your journey.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nOn the beach, Chetney reveals he has carved an exact wooden copy of the compass that will summon the ghost pirates to take them to the island of Kalutha where Evontra'vir is located, southeast of where they are now. FCG suggests they summon the pirates and immediately put the compass in the unlocatable portable hole to use as a bargaining chip. This reminds them of the bodies currently in there and they decide to clear it out by using Speak with Dead on the bodies.\n\n![Imogen and Ratanish by Dadrielle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/74/Imogen_and_Ratanish_by_Dadrielle.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20230923104657)\n\nThe first target is a druid underling, for practice. They make Imogen look like her mother and under questioning, the druid states that Otohan Thull is still at the Malleus Key . that a \"hundred or more\" reilora have arrived from Ruidus , and that Ludinus Da'leth 's forces are attempting to keep the forces opposing them scattered. FCG then casts on Ratanish 's body, and \" Liliana \" tells him he can be brought back to life if he answers her questions. He tells her the Ruby Vanguard are communicating \"the old-fashioned way\" because of the solstice -induced communication disruptions. But he becomes suspicious of her and stops answering truthfully. When she asks what happened to Caleb Widogast and Beauregard Lionett , he answers they are probably dead.\n\nAshton disposes of the bodies. Chetney dips the compass into the water to summon the ghost pirates, and they see the shadowy shape of a massive ghostly ship, the Crimson Abyss , appear just offshore. Ten skeletal figures wearing bits of tattered armor begin approaching through the water as the party discusses their approach to the coming negotiations. A voice echoes from the ship: \"Take it from them. Leave them bleeding. Whatever they have is ours.\" And with that, initiative begins.\n\n![Battlemap 3x72](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/7/76/Battlemap_3x72.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20230920142206)\n\nAt the outset, Ashton starts a Space rage. He and Orym are both able to severely wound the attackers, killing one. The water around them, however, swirls into a massive whirlpool and the attackers radiate cold. The ghost pirate captain Urlu Novos sneers at Chetney's offer of the wooden fake compass before Laudna casts a fireball that takes out eight of the nine remaining skeletons. In Shadow Cant , she asks Novos if he's sure he doesn't want to make a deal and he now accepts, but only as to her. He shouts to his crew to kill the others and a sniper in the crow's nest hits FCG with two heavy crossbow bolts for massive piercing and cold damage. The crewmembers who were \"killed\" by the Fireball rise and heal, then attack, surrounding much of the party. FCG uses Turn Undead against them, but hits Laudna as well, compelling her to do nothing but move away as fast as she can.\n\nOrym is able to reach the ship and attack the first mate, while Ashton slaps Laudna and shakes her out of her compulsion. Chetney and Laudna also get aboard the ship but the sniper hits FCG again, knocking him unconscious. All of the skeletons that the party \"killed\" in the past turn rise once more, although those affected by Turn Undead continue to run away. Fearne casts Cure Wounds on FCG bringing him back to consciousness while the others continue to battle pirates. Ashton is able to knock the sniper from her perch to the deck, but another pirate hits FCG and knocks him out again, forcing Fearne to use Cure Wounds a second time on him.\n\n![Laudna and the captain by Cha Cha Rae](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/f/fc/Laudna_and_the_captain_by_Cha_Cha_Rae.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230926084432)\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna reaches the captain and puts his hand inside her chest to demonstrate her undead status. She tells him they are alike, both cursed, and they can end it together, but he responds that he chose this curse: the Strife Emperor gave him renewed fury. He asks what else she offers, and she uses Silent Image to make an image first of the compass, then of Graz'tchar , telling him the sword gives the strength of 100 holy men and radiant abilities. Around them, although the party can kill the pirates fairly easily, they almost immediately revive, and Bells Hells are taking serious damage. Chetney holds up Graz'tchar, telling the captain they want only passage in return and the captain is intrigued, demanding both the compass and sword in trade. Chetney is reluctant (as is the sword) but hands it to Captain Novos. The crew stop fighting and begin making their way back to the ship.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Failed intimidation - Elaine Tipping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nLaudna calls to the others to come aboard; they're all friends now. The party joins the now-healthy skeletal pirate crew on the Crimson Abyss and Laudna introduces Bells Hells as sort of pirates themselves. Captain Novos introduces Woedders, the first mate, who introduces the crew. Chetney explains they need passage to Kalutha , and the captain demands the compass in payment in advance as well. After Laudna fails to intimidate him, Chetney hands it over. The captain explains that the ship is in relentless pursuit of the belongings stolen from him when he and the crew were killed by their enemies, although they aren't sure what will happen when they recover all of them.\n\nThe ship sets sail, and the captain tells them it will take three days to reach Kalutha. He invites them to relax and make friends with the crew, but his quarters are off limits. This immediately catches Fearne 's interest. Ashton discovers the Captain is completely unaware of what's going on with Ruidus and the gods. Laudna asks about Novos' devotion to the Strife Emperor , and the party shares that all the gods are currently under threat. Chetney and FCG suggest the party might be able to help the captain find more of the missing objects, but he excuses himself, saying they've talked enough.\n\nFCG asks Chetney if he's okay giving up Graz'tchar , and although Chetney's unhappy, he felt it was his duty. They go through some of the things they've acquired, and FCG Identifies Ratanish's boots [1] as Boots of Speed . Both Chetney and Ashton want them, but in a two-out-of-three Rollies match Ashton wins them. Ashton offers to trade them for Chetney's Ring of Temporal Salvation , and Chetney accepts.\n\n![Ghost pirate learning Rollies - TheFakeNerdGirl](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nThe group explores the ship a bit. Ashton climbs the crow's nest to talk to Cyrillia , the one-eyed navigator, and draws her out, discovering that she may feel some resentment toward the captain about her situation. He tells her he recently got a god to notice him and it didn't like him, so he's considering not liking them right back. Things are changing, and even the god who cursed this ship may not be long for this world. Cyrillia has noticed Ruidus has been missing from the sky lately, and listens to him intently.\n\nThe rest of the group goes below and meets the rest of the crew. It is noticeably colder there, and the crew is reluctant to discuss the captain or reveal any dissatisfaction with their situation. Orym requests the violinist play Beads of Love by Scanlan Shorthalt , and he does so, while Fearne explores and finds the captain's quarters. They learn there are no cannons, but the ship has recently found some pistols. Imogen teaches the crew Rollies with traded secrets as the wagers, but the crewmember's secret is only that he was allergic to cats. The crew, however, is enchanted with this game.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e72-phantasmal_parley"}
{"fields":{"title":"C3E78-Fractures","content":"### Previously on Critical Role [ ]\n\nSo, last we left off: Bells Hells , after an extended excursion to the Shattered Teeth , learning more and more about the history of Ashton 's youthful transformation into what you now know to be some sort of elemental humanoid , genasi -esque it seems, carrying within them a dormant seed, a broken shard, of one of the ancient primordial titans . You made your path through these islands, acquired another chunk of one of these primordial titans that might be used to awaken this dormant shard. Given numerous bits of information about its history, the possible power within and warnings attached, returned to Whitestone to both convey the information you gathered to the allies that you've made, who are hoping to soon wage a massive front against the Malleus Key , but they lack information about what resides on the opposite side of the moon, and the worry of destroying the key before knowing too much could leave Ludinus completely left to his own machinations, unable to be stopped. So the bridge must be maintained for now and information is to be gathered.\n\nYou, Bells Hells, volunteered to be the recon mission to the moon and back. You gathered materials from your allies, Arcanist Allura Vysoren , member of the Tal'Dorei Council , making your acquaintance and providing what materials were on hand to help hopefully aid you on this recon mission. Before you left, Fearne and Ashton had a discussion to find a way to awaken the dormant shard of the titan within. In asking for a space to do this, you were shown to a subterranean layer beneath Whitestone where there seemed to be an ancient ziggurat , itself coated with layers of residuum glass. This platform of power at the top was where the two of you brought the harness and asked for some privacy. While your friends waited out of sight and Allura put up a barrier to protect any wayward magical energies from damaging the surrounding cavern and Whitestone above, Ashton decided to take the shard into himself. The words from Evontra'vir , the Tree of Atrophy, echoing in the mind of those around that both shards within one vessel would likely destroy it, and upon the process beginning, Ashton's physical form was brought, not just to its limits, but past it, twice. Thanks to some careful preparatory spellcasting and a ring taken by an old flame , and some fucking lucky rolls at the end, Ashton lost an arm and then gained a new one, bouncing back and forth on the cusp of death before eventually the process completed, and with just a shred of consciousness to you, you looked upon your newly formed molten rock arm before Fearne kicked you in the head and knocked you unconscious.\n\n### Part I [ ]\n\nThe heat continues fading from Ashton 's unconscious body but Fearne is still furious. The others confront her and she admits she knew Ashton was going to do that. She didn't want the shard because it scared her, even though everything had warned them Ashton shouldn't have both shards. FCG casts Cure Wounds bringing Ashton back to consciousness, but Fearne immediately tries to hit him with his hammer, missing but repeatedly slamming it into the ground by his head until FCG catches it and tells her to stop. Fearne grabs the harness and stalks down the ziggurat stairs. Chetney runs after her.\n\n![Ashton and the shard - Melissa Hahn](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/1/13/Ashton_and_the_shard_-_Melissa_Hahn.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20231120152847)\n\nLaudna is more quietly furious, battling her deep sense of betrayal. Imogen 's Detect Thoughts learns that Ashton is realizing there is a pattern in his life of hubris and blaming others, particularly his father , for the horrors in his past, but it took him only one week to do the exact same thing they did. As FCG sits Ashton up, the dormant earth shard within Ashton seems to start strengthening, creating a burning pain within him that eventually causes the violent expulsion of the flame shard, reformed into a glowing, burning orange crystal (and permanently reducing Ashton's CON score by 2). His right arm is now made of jagged, black volcanic rock.\n\nLaudna is hearing the pulsing heartbeat of Delilah in her mind and is trying to resist her anger at Ashton's betrayal, admitting everything is telling her Ashton should have died. Delilah's voice tells her, \"Ignore the fool. Your focus is before you.\" Her eyes drift to the crystal before Laudna forces them away. Saying Ashton can't be trusted anymore, Laudna walks off, succeeding on a Wisdom saving throw to walk away from the crystal.\n\nFCG asks Ashton why they did that, saying it wasn't stupid, it was power hungry. Ashton's explanation is very confused and it's clear they aren't quite sure what they wanted, aside from hoping maybe it would fix them. Instead, it made everything worse. Ashton apologizes, finally saying they just wanted someone to blame. Imogen tells him that what just happened is his fault, but what happened to him earlier in his life, he needs to let go. Although Ashton thought the shard would make him better and stronger to help the rest of the group, Imogen tells him he doesn't need power to be better, and FCG suggests he start by talking to Fearne.\n\nMeanwhile, Chetney catches up to Fearne in the tunnels beneath Whitestone . She wants to destroy the harness. Chetney asks her what happened, and she explains she never wanted the shard and when Ashton did, she just went along with it. She was scared because she's seen bad versions of herself [2] [3] and she was afraid the shard might make her into one. She knows it was really dumb, but she's furious at both Ashton and herself. Chetney surreptitiously slips the harness away from her while she talks. She admits she likes Ashton a little bit, and maybe she went along with it to make him happy. Chetney tells her Ashton's really cool and he likes him too, but sometimes you need to seize an opportunity. Fearne would use the shard for at least 50% good reasons, and the group would be there to guide her. And Fearne can always talk to him. If she still feels like breaking something, the castle has a lot of windows.\n\nMeanwhile, Laudna is still walking away through the tunnels, transforming into her Form of Dread as soon as she's out of sight. Imogen, FCG, and Ashton tell Allura Vysoren they won't be leaving this afternoon as planned. Imogen goes in fruitless search of Laudna, while FCG and Ashton talk briefly and Ashton admits he needs to start caring about himself. FCG pledges that they'll help each other and get through this.\n\nChetney and Fearne are throwing rocks through the windows of the castle. Eventually Fearne decides to go for a walk, and Chetney makes her promise not to leave. She goes to the temple of the Matron of Ravens , telling the statue of her Champion they're trying to get him out as she passes. Fearne goes to the altar and prays, telling the Matron she's scared of what she could turn into and is seeking guidance. She leaves the postcards she had believed were from her parents on the altar as an offering. As she leaves, she sees a young one-legged raven being brought food by its parents.\n\nLaudna has found her way into the woods, while Ashton finds Lord de Rolo standing among the shards of glass in the garden. They talk, and Ashton admits he's fucked up hard, and doesn't know if he's worth trusting. Percival tells him to do everything he can to make up for it, punish himself as much as he needs to, but don't drag the others down with him.\n\nAt dinnertime, Fearne and Laudna still haven't returned. Imogen speaks to Allura, who tells them to take the time they need to feel confident and cohesive as a group again. Chetney casts Grim Psychometry on the shard, seeing a vision of an inferno in a time when the elements ruled Exandria , the growth of a civilization destroyed in warfare with the deities , endless time tethered under a mountain to be freed and joined with another for an instant before sudden nothingness. Imogen is very worried about Laudna, and FCG promises he'll use a spell to find her in the morning if she hasn't returned, and flips the Coin of the Changebringer to confirm she is currrently safe.\n\nChetney abruptly tells Ashton he should leave. If Ashton wants to do dangerous things on his own, he can, but he shouldn't put the rest of them in danger. Chetney doesn't trust Ashton; he could have hurt Fearne. Ashton doesn't know if he's going or staying, and in the end it isn't his decision. If they let him stay, if Chetney ever hurts people, Ashton will help him clean it up and Chetney will get no shit from him.\n\nIn the forest, Laudna hears Delilah's voice: \"Just like old times, Laudna. Others come and go but I am always here. Just you and me, always.\" Laudna asks her about love; is it always pain? Is it ever worth it? Laudna has seen the pain: Delilah lost her love , Imogen's father couldn't look at his daughter after his wife left, Orym is defined by losing his husband , Keyleth can't get away from her past. Delilah replies that the strong find a way to fix the pain, to change their fortunes, and hurt those who hurt them. Ashton has barely figured out who they are, and is still a child. Laudna doesn't want to hurt children; she loves them. She decides to make Ashton a doll, and finds her way to her old cabin.\n\n### Part II [ ]\n\n![Laudna sleeping - Mintywolf](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/c/cb/Laudna_sleeping_-_Mintywolf.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/325?cb=20231119172653)\n\nAs evening falls, Fearne creates a sleeping space in the woods resembling her bedroom in Ligament Manor , while Laudna finds her old burned hut. Delilah urges her to build again, but Laudna is more focused on creating a doll for Ashton . She carves a graffitied curse word from the wall and crafts a doll with scraps and the skull of a chipmunk. When it is finished, Delilah suggests she could trade it for the shard, because power helps both of them. Perhaps Laudna needs to teach Ashton a lesson. Matilda is dead, and Laudna is something more. As Laudna falls asleep, she holds the Ashton doll close.\n\nIn the morning, Fearne and Laudna both head back toward the castle , but in the meantime Imogen has panicked and has FCG cast Locate Creature . She admits Delilah came back the previous day and she's very worried. Chetney and Ashton meet in the breakfast room, where Chetney transforms into a werewolf and attacks him to \"test his new arm\", but there doesn't seem to be much difference with an unarmed strike. Chetney goes back to gnome form and they go in search of the others. FCG eventually gets a magical ping on Laudna's location and they run into Fearne (acting perfectly normal) on the way. However, when Laudna sees Ashton in the group approaching her, she turns and runs.\n\nChetney is able to easily catch up with her, tackling her to the ground. Laudna tells him to keep her away from Ashton or she's going to kill him. Imogen approaches and they apologize to each other before Laudna tells her the same thing, but she is childlike and confused. Imogen telepathically orders Ashton back to the castle and he quietly retreats. Launda admits she's been talking to Delilah and that Delilah wants the shard, but Laudna thinks it's Fearne's, and demands to know if Ashton hurt or manipulated her into going along with his plans. Fearne denies this, saying it was her fault, and Imogen assures Laudna that Ashton is not a bad person, just dumb. She telepathically tells FCG she's never seen Laudna like this - it's like she's reverted, and FCG agrees, saying they can't go forward with their mission while everyone is this messed up.\n\nChetney tells the others that he told Ashton to leave the night before, but the fact that Ashton stayed means something. Fearne suggests that if they need a little more time, they could go to Nana Morri's in the Fey Realm and use its time anomalies to their advantage. Plus, she admits she's a little homesick. Maybe Lady Vysoren can get them there. Laudna shows them the doll, but she hasn't decided whether she's going to give it to Ashton yet. They decide to go in search of them.\n\n![Laudna's doll - Misha Leigh](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/2/24/Laudna%27s_doll_-_Misha_Leigh.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231122222547)\n\nWhen the group finds Ashton, Imogen refuses to tell Laudna who's holding the shard. Laudna, without looking at Ashton, holds out the doll, telling him that dolls are for children, and he's a child. Ashton replies that he's never had a doll before. It's the nicest thing anyone's ever given him. Still herself very childlike, Laudna asks if he really likes it and is thrilled when he says he does. Ashton apologizes to her, and promises to try their best not to be that person if they let them stay. No matter what, they will not walk away. Ashton doesn't know what love is, but they'll go with this. Laudna says love is pain, but then adds it's also warmth, and Imogen hugs her. FCG hugs Ashton. Laudna admits she's still mad and doesn't trust Ashton, but thanks them for the apology.\n\nFCG announces they're going to take a day off and have fun together in the Fey Realm. They check with Allura, finding her in the library, who while a little surprised by the timing, is happy to Plane Shift with them if that's what they need to bring them back together. She reminds them, however, the clock is ticking and they don't know how much time they have. Imogen's pretty sure Nana Morri will help with that, and Allura is surprised to learn Fearne's grandmother is The Fatestitcher . She telepathically tells Imogen that Morrigan is one of the more notorious figures of the Fey Realm.\n\nWhile Allura leaves to tell Percival their plans, Ashton takes Fearne into a private corner, telling her he needs a book on apologies. Fearne was just being a good friend, and he took advantage. He wants her to know she didn't do anything wrong and he's going to try very hard for it never to happen again. He just wants everyone to be safe. Fearne tells him it was awful to watch. She thinks she's still really mad and can't really talk about it all yet, because she doesn't really like him right now. And she has the feeling he feels the same way about himself. But she's glad he's still alive.\n\n![Allura in her travel garb - Sami Jen](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)\n\nAllura returns, dressed for travel, has them hold hands, and casts the spell, pulling them into the Fey Realm and in front of Ligament Manor . Fearne is thrilled to be home, and greets Peepers with delight. From elsewhere in the house, they hear Nana Morri's voice, as well as that of Birdie Calloway , Fearne's mother. Nana is still recovering from her injuries received the last time they were in the Feywild. There's a large crystal ball on the table that Morri explains is being used to peer in on someone she likes to watch fail. Birdie explains that Ollie 's Squint ability to see the future told them the Hideaway was about to be besieged. They buried it so it would remain unfound and found the nearest gate to the Fey Realm.\n\nFearne introduces a very nervous Allura, and FCG confirms Morri can get them back to the Prime Material Plane without time having passed there. They also ask her help in putting together a scavenger hunt, which excites her. She is also interested to hear they're planning to visit Ruidus , and uses the crystal ball to show them the strain on the ley lines being created by the moon's static position. Being able to influence fate doesn't mean she can know the outcome; it's more being able to predict the ripples a tug or a knot will cause in the threads. She can affect thinner threads more, but some threads are very taut and bound to history. Only the Raven Queen can affect-- or cut-- those. Fearne's fate is in flux, but Morri has known since her birth that she is a beautiful paradox who must be kept safe. Fearne's true heritage required Morri's attention, and she's happy to help. Maybe they're at the end of the string.\n\nFearne is taken aback. She tells Morri she saw a bad version of herself once and it frightened her. Morri agrees she needs answers, but they are not hers to give. Fearne's mother keeps a deep, dark secret that Fearne deserves to know, and speaking with her might be illuminating. Fearne asks about the Matron, and is told she's complicated. Morri doesn't see eye to eye with her but they have an understanding. Fearne then asks about Asmodeus and tells her grandmother about the kiss and promise from Teven Klask . [4] Commenting that Fearne and her mother are more alike than Fearne knows, Morri explains the mark is a promise and a chance for a trade, but such trades rarely end in one's favor.\n\nBirdie and Ollie come downstairs and Ollie hugs Fearne happily. Chetney uses Hunter's Bane, learning Morri gives off \"dirty fey\" vibes. Ollie begins preparing a meal and Morri grows a new chamber for them all.\n\n"},"put":"id:space:wiki::c3e78-fractures"}
